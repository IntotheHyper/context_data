(This is also a lie from my end, as there aren't any royal drums because the British wouldn't make any they would steal them from Asia)

[09/29/2022 5:49 PM] 5298_
For years the good people of Walney have been slaves, slaves for the South! Our homes were built for the men of the shipyard, the work of that yard went to the South! The ships went to the South, our money went to the South and what did we get in return for our labour, determination and resolve to carry on? We got higher rent, higher taxes, higher bills and misrepresentation in the media. I ask you, where is the BBC situated? London! For Walney to survive in the neglect from the South we must become a free republic, and I plan to lead us away from the neglect of the South and into a prosperous future.

It is my goal to fight for our independence and expand our borders into mailand Furness. I plan to do this peacefully so as to spare any of our good men losing their lives in the fight for freedom. I will debate freedom in Westminster and try to get a vote for the freedom of our nation. We will then take Barrow so we can have the shipyard and farmland, we will use this to sell ships and create a naval fleet to defend our shores and take the coastal wind farm. Any excess energy will be sold. With our new navy and resurgence of farming I will create jobs for more people. I will also ensure we meet every climate goal we can and make Walney one of the most environmentally friendly nations in the world. 

I will make schools focus more on DT to help young people get jobs within Walney, I will lower choosing class options to the end of year 8 so that our young people can get the education they want


[09/29/2022 5:49 PM] 5298_
that's what I have so far


[09/29/2022 5:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Realistically from where we are it would be Northern Ireland but in my eyes Northern Ireland shouldn't exist

Any symbolism mr mulvey


[10/01/2022 5:11 PM] 5298_
Red is for the struggle for freedom and British Heritage ( the British part is only to show who our oppressors are )
Green is for hope of better days and the agriculture which is prevalent in our country 
Blue is for freedom and peace 
Black is for determination 
The flower is the official flower of Cumbria to show our Celtic pride


[10/01/2022 5:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good symbolism

[10/01/2022 5:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
will thinks this as well


[10/01/2022 5:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I warned him that the FRW and Imperial Party have enough evidence to prove he has rigged the upcoming election, the Republic of South End will declare independence.


[10/01/2022 5:34 PM] 5298_
Reece is the fascist isn't he?

[10/01/2022 6:33 PM] 5298_

[10/01/2022 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
a leader cant edit results


[10/01/2022 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they can edit the form, but i think changes only count when voting if the person does it after editing


[10/01/2022 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i will screenshot the results too


[10/01/2022 6:35 PM] 5298_
What?


[10/01/2022 6:35 PM] 5298_
Anyways, we just can't have Reece counting the ballots


[10/01/2022 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill screenshot the form as it is too so you can compare changes


[10/01/2022 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[10/01/2022 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[10/01/2022 6:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
do you think i should put leader names as well


[10/01/2022 6:37 PM] 5298_
We also need to figure out if FRW and imperial are merging, although we could do it where if one of us wins we could put the other as second in command. That way we maximise the possibility of winning


[10/01/2022 6:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good idea we should discuss it with will


[10/01/2022 6:38 PM] 5298_
If we merge we have a 33% chance of winning and if we don't we have a 50% chance that either of us will win

After the election it will be blatantly obvious, if we want a second term we'll have three options


[10/02/2022 9:17 PM] 5298_
1. Keep it secret
2. Pray the voters don't care 
3. Dictatorship, although our policy is literally to stamp out tyranny and I'm not one for dictatorships


[10/02/2022 9:17 PM] 5298_
Reminds me too much of the British Empire


[10/02/2022 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In response to 3, as far as I'm aware all parties are dictatorships. I'd argue dictatorship =/= tyranny. If someone does not trip on power as a dictator, it'd probably be beneficial in some ways, especially if they're considered great, whilst other parties aren't.


[10/02/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'd go with 1 though


[10/02/2022 9:22 PM] 5298_
In my opinion all parties aren't dictatorships, if you give up your power after your term and only run if you have a term left that's completely democratic, you also can't commit voter fraud but that's another point


[10/02/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Technically we are kinda a dictatorship as we'll be the first leaders of this nation so the constitution will be written by us so our power is dictated by us

Theres already been elections and there is a leader but we'll be the first to actually get some sort of ball rolling

You have to follow the laws of your constitution, if you don't and just do what ever you want without any regard for the constitution you're a dictatorship

[10/02/2022 9:30 PM] 5298_
Democracy, we hold elections for each decree we want in the constitution, like the house of commons and lords except less corrupt and the other way around. We write the decree and hold a vote for if it should be added. Although that could very easily be taken advantage of


[10/02/2022 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes, and because there's only 3 of us at the moment, we can all just add stuff we want and vote yes.


[10/02/2022 9:32 PM] 5298_
I meant for the 100+ people voting in the election to choose


[10/02/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[10/02/2022 10:11 PM] 5298_
Who's Marsha?


[10/02/2022 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Reece's nana who is for some reason taking part in this election


[10/02/2022 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I expect a landslide for reece and probably some votes for marsha


[10/02/2022 10:12 PM] 5298_
We can't let Reece do the vote, we have to stop him


[10/02/2022 10:12 PM] 5298_
That's not a required question for voting unless you're in fuckin Russia

[10/02/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he said hes trying to see where the points are


[10/02/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
voter intention if you will


[10/02/2022 10:13 PM] 5298_
This could be useful


[10/02/2022 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I could 100% rig this its so easy


[10/02/2022 10:14 PM] 5298_
If it's in a far majority for him we know he'll cheat and if it isn't but the general election is then we know he cheated


[10/02/2022 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its voter intention but i could rig this and bring some unexpected results to the table


[10/02/2022 10:14 PM] 5298_
Does Will not have a party?


[10/02/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Me and will lead one party together


[10/02/2022 10:15 PM] 5298_
Ohhh


[10/02/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm the more politically active one tho


[10/02/2022 10:15 PM] 5298_
That makes sense

[10/02/2022 10:30 PM] 5298_
I'm going to do a survey when there, see how many people are in support of our ideas and try and play the field a bit. Get anyone on the fence to our side


[10/02/2022 10:37 PM] 5298_
I have a military plan, should I make that public knowledge.


[10/02/2022 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nope


[10/02/2022 10:37 PM] 5298_
It could be risky to share everything but if people are voting for Reece because of his military plans it could help


[10/02/2022 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm spamming myself on this poll to make reece more nervous


[10/02/2022 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not yet


[10/02/2022 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i need your input on whether i should or not


[10/02/2022 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Reece hasnt shared military plans yet


[10/02/2022 10:38 PM] 5298_
True


[10/02/2022 10:38 PM] 5298_
He could use it against you


[10/02/2022 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[10/02/2022 10:38 PM] 5298_
Voting more then once is voter fraud I'm pretty sure


[10/02/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It is voter intention


[10/02/2022 10:39 PM] 5298_
Rig the site


[10/02/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in the election nobody will be able to vote twice due to email confirmation and whilst that doesnt stop it fully temporary emails are easy to spot


[10/02/2022 10:40 PM] 5298_
Rig it in favour of Martha and show him that it's easy to break, if he doesn't give the poll to a third party then we have him in a corner


[10/02/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im spamming me you and marsha now


[10/02/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im gonna tell him in asec


[10/02/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
a sec


[10/02/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
a good plan to push him towards me doing the polling on forms


[10/02/2022 10:44 PM] 5298_
We can't have you do it either


[10/02/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[10/02/2022 10:44 PM] 5298_
It _needs_ to be a third party if it isn't Reece will win


[10/02/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dylan you need to look into google forms


[10/02/2022 10:44 PM] 5298_
It's either Reece rigs it or calls us frauds


[10/02/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it does all the counting and shit


[10/02/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its the closest thing to third party


[10/02/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
everyone is biased towards reece


[10/02/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
can i run a test on it quickly to demonstrate


[10/02/2022 10:46 PM] 5298_
Okay, fair enough but you need to be prepared for some backlash. We can't afford to face propaganda right now

[10/02/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
go through this quickly


[10/02/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
This is also a good way of finding ways to improve


[10/02/2022 10:46 PM] 5298_
We're doing detective work to stop Reece from rigging it for God's sake we aren't prepared


[10/02/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
You can rig it

I could easily write a different email


[10/02/2022 10:49 PM] 5298_
Then get two votes


[10/02/2022 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
See it shows you how many responses with the same name were received


[10/02/2022 10:49 PM] 5298_
Watch


[10/02/2022 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is true, but its much better than the polling shit reece is using


[10/02/2022 10:50 PM] 5298_
Different email, different name


[10/02/2022 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is really obvious, but reece would probably know who he sent the emails to and know that dylan oneill isnt a person who that was sent to

I know dylanmulvey1 is an example but if that were the case that would also most likely be discarded


[10/02/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
And what's stopping someone from voting for someone else


[10/02/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
Electronic voting in of itself is flawed


[10/02/2022 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
plus if you do a little cross thingying then you could put 2 and 2 together and say hold up that name in the email doesnt quite match up with the name given


[10/02/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
We aren't going to solve this


[10/02/2022 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes, but like I said way better than Reece was doing


[10/02/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
Better but not perfect


[10/02/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and its better than walking 3 hours handing out and collecting some sheets of paper then waiting for someone to count and then walk home for another 3 hours


[10/02/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There still is no perfect way of electing an official tho i think


[10/02/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
even paper ballots can be rigged


[10/02/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Much harder, but riggable


[10/02/2022 10:54 PM] 5298_
Or if you look at it a different way, talking to friends for 6 hours whilst winning a country


[10/02/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[10/02/2022 11:02 PM] 5298_
We should meet up at break tomorrow and talk about this


[10/02/2022 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I need to see if we can get enough votes for independence


[10/05/2022 8:33 PM] 5298_
I have a plan


[10/05/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[10/05/2022 8:34 PM] 5298_
Northumbria will become a country but we will agree to join the U.K. then get independence (with us now having some of England's voters) for our Celtic brothers


[10/05/2022 8:34 PM] 5298_
Then form the Celtic Union


[10/05/2022 8:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
UP THE CELTIC UNION


[10/05/2022 9:00 PM] 5298_
What's your party name?


[10/05/2022 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Walney National Party

[10/05/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if reece rigs the election


[10/05/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we declare independence


[10/05/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then rush to the capital south end


[10/05/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then we push them back


[10/05/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
since they wont be prepared


[10/05/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
all the way  to vickerstown


[10/05/2022 9:13 PM] 5298_
If Reece rigs the election we need to declare independence outside of Walney and then starve out the country until they give us the land


[10/05/2022 9:13 PM] 5298_
What are they gonna do? They're trapped on a tiny island and most of it is fucking beech


[10/05/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
make a raft


[10/05/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and swim to blackpool


[10/05/2022 9:13 PM] 5298_
We control most of the business, food and transport


[10/05/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or they buy a fucking boat and they move to dublin


[10/05/2022 9:14 PM] 5298_
And then we take the island


[10/05/2022 9:34 PM] 5298_

What I want to know is why he killed them and *then* raped them, seems like a weird order. If you're going to be a psychopath at least don't give yourself an STI

Self diagnosis is good if you can't get a real one and you do the amount of research you need to not reading half a Facebook post made by a neurotypical  middle aged mother with an autistic son she beats half to death when he has special needs based on his autism


[10/13/2022 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its never good imo


[10/13/2022 8:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If you cant get a real chances are you dont fit the requirements to get tested for said mental illness


[10/13/2022 8:21 PM] 5298_
I think it can help people understand what they have but it should always be taken with a grain of salt and they should get a real one when they get the chance


[10/13/2022 8:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[10/13/2022 8:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but like i said if they cant get a test chances are theyre either doing something or you dont meet the requirements for a test


[10/13/2022 8:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Someone in this discord server im in says theyre autistic but cant get a test so they self diagnosed themselves with it


[10/13/2022 8:24 PM] 5298_
If they do enough research I think it's alright to say they might have autisms


[10/13/2022 8:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Might is the most they should go


[10/13/2022 8:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Reece is about to start the riggin jiggin


[10/13/2022 9:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Back to 50/50


[10/13/2022 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We have half the vote


[10/13/2022 9:09 PM] 5298_
Hmmm


[10/13/2022 9:10 PM] 5298_
Send this to everyone you can, if Reece won't give us voters we'll find them ourselves


[10/13/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Reece noticed that we're winning and finally sent the form out


[10/13/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Start spamming everyones dms


[10/13/2022 9:15 PM] 5298_
Well you see Rylan, I don't have any friends


[10/13/2022 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[10/13/2022 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's 50/50 again


[10/13/2022 9:19 PM] 5298_
If collectively we have a majority but with us split it's Reece who is winning we join to win, if one of us had a majority that person wins we join


[10/13/2022 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WE SHOULD BE BACK IN LEAD


[10/13/2022 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[10/13/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WE MIGHT WIN


[10/13/2022 9:25 PM] 5298_
We have to wait until 100 otherwise Reece will call for a re-election if we stop the vote and we win before we originally said


[10/13/2022 9:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if votes were to expontentially increase based on trends this is what we would be looking at by tuesday

That's the difference a vote makes lmfao


[10/13/2022 9:42 PM] 5298_
We'll win if that's the case


[10/13/2022 9:45 PM] 5298_
Even without those numbers the odds are still good. You alone have 59% of the vote


[10/13/2022 9:45 PM] 5298_
Adding me that's 78%

58.3% if we add


[10/13/2022 9:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[10/13/2022 9:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm doing some more data to see what our percentage could rise to


[10/13/2022 9:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
BY 12:00AM


[10/13/2022 9:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i doubt itll change too much in the next few hours


[10/13/2022 9:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
should be set in stone till reece comes up with a plan


[10/13/2022 9:47 PM] 5298_
Right wing has 41.7% of the vote and left has 58.3%


[10/13/2022 9:47 PM] 5298_
When we add I'll just call it left for simplicity


[10/13/2022 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[10/13/2022 10:05 PM] 5298_
Stop telling him the votes, he'll be more likely to rig if he thinks he's majorly losing


[10/13/2022 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ok


[10/13/2022 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Yes you can Rylan


[10/13/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
With the hills to the north,
And the bay to the south,
Our brothers best,
Out to the west,
You'll find us there!

Oh, great Walney isle!
Oh, great Walney isle!
Fight for our liberty,
And Celtic synergy, 
Oh, great Walney isle!

Take back our home
Cumberland's owed
The many hills and lakes
The valley shakes
To the Brits, the pride we showed,

Oh, great Walney isle!
Oh, great Walney isle!
Fight for our liberty, 
And Celtic synergy, 
Oh, great Walney isle!


[10/13/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
made very minor change


[10/13/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
should we have 2 different sets of choruses


[10/13/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so the the first one


[10/13/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then we have like a slightly different one


[10/13/2022 10:20 PM] 5298_
Sure, but if it doesn't fit the rhythm I'll say


[10/13/2022 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Alright


[10/13/2022 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it might take a bit to think of something of something lmao


[10/13/2022 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh, Great Walney Isle!
Oh, Great Walney Isle!
Those dirty English, go away!
Or you may never see another day,
Ruling over our
Great Walney Isle!


[10/13/2022 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also, ive got evidence of reece rigging


[10/13/2022 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Hmmmmm


[10/13/2022 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also if that was marsha the vote doesnt count anyway since she voted for her own party


[10/13/2022 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A lower case last name


[10/13/2022 10:28 PM] 5298_
Oh yeahh


[10/13/2022 10:28 PM] 5298_
Has Reece voted? Did he do a lowercase last name?


[10/13/2022 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nope


[10/13/2022 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But here me out


[10/13/2022 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Reece would likely have access to both of their accounts


[10/13/2022 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im not sure


[10/13/2022 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the vote doesnt count anyway


[10/13/2022 10:31 PM] 5298_
I'd do 
Oh great Walney isle
Oh great Walney isle
Get the English away
They'll end today
Oh great Walney isle!


[10/13/2022 10:31 PM] 5298_
That fits the rhythm


[10/13/2022 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We need to get the rhythm down somewhere because we 100% have different rhythms in our head


[10/13/2022 10:33 PM] 5298_
Yeah


[10/13/2022 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should win the elections unless reece starts sending the poll to absolutely everyone


[10/13/2022 10:36 PM] 5298_
Send it to everyone you know who will vote and then tell them do the same

October spooky


[10/16/2022 8:30 PM] 5298_
Also October is Black history month


[10/16/2022 8:30 PM] 5298_
Why did they do that?


[10/16/2022 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what a stupid fucking time for such a month


[10/16/2022 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its like its calling black people monsters lmfao


[10/16/2022 8:30 PM] 5298_
Why is black history month on the one time of year everyone associates with terror and evil?

That wasn't learning about black history it was the training week for new slaves


[10/16/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
also there's 2 black history months


[10/16/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what is the point


[10/16/2022 8:32 PM] 5298_
We shouldn't even have black history month, we should teach it in normal history


[10/16/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[10/16/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the fact theres 2 black history months is stupid


[10/16/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i get millions of black people where enslave


[10/16/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
enslaved


[10/16/2022 8:33 PM] 5298_
If black history month is anti racist then why have the segregated black and white history?


[10/16/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but hasnt every other race been enslaved?


[10/16/2022 8:34 PM] 5298_
True, but I don't think it was as prolific and didn't have such a big impact as the African Slave Trade


[10/16/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[10/16/2022 8:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If everyone wants complete equality, no race or no group of people should have months dedicated to them


[10/16/2022 8:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in my eyes at least


[10/16/2022 8:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nobody is special


[10/16/2022 8:35 PM] 5298_
Romans kept Jewish slaves but we don't have that impact today, anti-Semitism isn't directly linked to Roman slavery


[10/16/2022 8:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
true


[10/16/2022 8:38 PM] 5298_
The act of having dedicated months is segregation, to have true equality history should teach what is important to that country, we learnt about the Black death because it affected England, we learn about the dark ages because it affected England, we learn about Henry the VIII because it affected England, we learn about the Roman Empire and the African Slave trade because they all affected England, we don't learn about the Romans slaves because we don't come from Italy or Israel


[10/16/2022 8:39 PM] 5298_
Other history should be mentioned for the people that want to learn it but not focused upon


[10/16/2022 8:39 PM] 5298_
We learn about MLK even though he wasn't English but his action affected racism world wide


[10/16/2022 8:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
to me if a black person or a white person or a person of anything did something historic, it shouldnt be lumped into its thing such as black history month


[10/16/2022 8:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its equally historic and should go down in the history books


[10/16/2022 8:43 PM] 5298_
Yeah, MLK is historic; same as Gandhi and Kind Henry VIII and Tutankhamen and Czar Nicholas and Queen Victoria. All different races and nationality but all important


[10/16/2022 8:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The fact they're lumped into a different category because of their race is racist


[10/16/2022 8:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in my eyes at least


[10/16/2022 8:44 PM] 5298_
Also, why is there a black history month but not an Asian? Or Australian? Or Native American or South American?


[10/16/2022 8:44 PM] 5298_
That seems pretty racist to me


[10/16/2022 8:46 PM] 5298_
The Native Americans have a rich and wonderful history that no one talks about, same with South America and Australia. And outside of Gandhi and the various Chinese Dynasties Asian history isn't talked about much either. The most they get is Japan in a mainly European War

Which is technically true as Nauru has 45% of its population being obese and America has 35%


[10/16/2022 10:32 PM] 5298_

Rylan, if the alliance between Barrow and North Walney is going to work out I need to make one thing clear. The tyrannical scum of South Walney is not and will never be accepted in Barrow and anyone who associates or negotiates with South Walney is not and will never be accepted in Barrow. I hope you can take this into consideration when dealing with Mr. MacDonald

When a Muslim astronaut is in space how do they pray?


[10/28/2022 6:40 PM] 5298_
If they're on the ISS they would be orbiting Earth too fast to keep facing Mecca


[10/28/2022 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats a good question


[10/28/2022 7:28 PM] 5298_
I'll consult Allah

just gonna quickly phone up homeboy allah


[10/28/2022 7:28 PM] 5298_

why are people raising concern over light pollution


[10/28/2022 7:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i get it affects animals and stuff


[10/28/2022 7:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but levels of light pollution are decreasing rapidly


[10/28/2022 7:51 PM] 5298_
It's annoying I'll give them that


[10/28/2022 7:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[10/28/2022 7:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But for example


[10/28/2022 7:51 PM] 5298_
I want to see space not a black void


[10/28/2022 7:51 PM] 5298_
But there are far worse things to worry about


[10/28/2022 7:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
all of walney used to have light pollution


[10/28/2022 7:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
now its only vickerstown


[10/28/2022 7:53 PM] 5298_
Like what's going on in Saudi Arabia, the war in Ukraine, the potential terrorism China might ensue due to Helium-3, American gun crime, the rise of fascism to name some


[10/28/2022 7:53 PM] 5298_
Not I can't see stars because of light

in my eyes


[10/28/2022 7:55 PM] 5298_
Why do people glorify Musk?


[10/28/2022 7:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not sure


[10/28/2022 7:55 PM] 5298_
People act like he's the next Tesla when he's more akin to Edison


[10/28/2022 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[10/28/2022 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like


[10/28/2022 7:56 PM] 5298_
He thinks he invented the underground


[10/28/2022 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he sits there and does nothing


[10/28/2022 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he hires people to do the things for him


[10/28/2022 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he doesnt even do the thinking


[10/28/2022 7:58 PM] 5298_
He ""came up with" a system for Tesla drivers to go underground and be moved from one station to the next by electric railway to stop traffic. That is just the underground


[10/28/2022 7:58 PM] 5298_
But he thinks it's his own creation because he's a moron


[10/28/2022 7:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also


[10/28/2022 7:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the iss passes over barrow in furness tonight not a lie


[10/28/2022 7:59 PM] 5298_
That's awesome, I wish we could actually fucking see it ( still don't like light pollution but I don't sit and cry because I may be a retard but I'm not retarded )


[10/28/2022 8:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We're 5 on the bortle scale

[10/28/2022 8:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I don't think that's right


[10/28/2022 8:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's based on satellite data


[10/28/2022 8:02 PM] 5298_
Although there is a traffic light right outside my window so that's probably the problem


[10/28/2022 8:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theres a couple of lights outside my window but theyre kinda dim


[10/28/2022 8:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my front street is the fucking a590 tho so its harder to see stuff out that way


[10/28/2022 8:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but since the milky way is northwest-southeast it should be easy to see


[10/28/2022 8:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when i was at south end i could see the milky way and i saw a shooting star


[10/28/2022 8:03 PM] 5298_
Mine got fixed after the storm so it's really fucking bright


[10/28/2022 8:04 PM] 5298_
I wish I could go out at night and go up to the top of Walney and see the milky way and the ISS


[10/28/2022 8:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That might be a lie


[10/28/2022 8:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that map isnt the bortle scale, but i downloaded an app which tells you the bortle scale for your location


[10/28/2022 8:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and for some reason it thinks im in devon


[10/28/2022 8:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was a bit confused


[10/28/2022 8:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I guess its like a 6-7 here but im not sure


[10/28/2022 8:05 PM] 5298_
Yeah, 6-7 seems more accurate


[10/28/2022 8:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Barrow is apparently 5 still


[10/28/2022 8:06 PM] 5298_
I can't wait until I'm at my father's in Dalton again so I can actually see some stars


[10/28/2022 8:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[10/28/2022 8:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
only hints of zodiacal light are seen on the best nights in autumn and spring
light pollution is visible in most, if not all, directions
clouds are noticeably brighter than the sky
the Milky Way is very weak or invisible near the horizon, and looks washed out overhead
when it is half moon (first/last quarter) in a dark location the sky appears like this, but with the difference that the sky appears dark blue
limiting magnitude with 12.5" reflector is 15


[10/28/2022 8:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
This describes bootle 5


[10/28/2022 8:07 PM] 5298_
I'm debating an all-nighter now


[10/28/2022 8:08 PM] 5298_

One of the characteristic of Bortles 5 is light pollution in every direction or nearly every direction


[10/28/2022 8:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Only about 50% of the sky has visible light pollution here id say

[10/28/2022 8:42 PM] 5298_
I do think the good is worth it but there is far much more harm caused by it


[10/28/2022 8:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure


[10/28/2022 8:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
id say its evens


[10/28/2022 8:43 PM] 5298_
There's more harm but the good outways it


[10/28/2022 8:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im not sure what my stance on the industrial revolution is


[10/28/2022 8:45 PM] 5298_
It's like 5 100kg waits versus 80 1kg waits, there's more 1kg waits but the 100kg out way it

NIRISS will be used to investigate the following science objectives: first light detection, exoplanet detection and characterization, and exoplanet transit spectroscopy.


[10/28/2022 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What do you think about that


[10/28/2022 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
do you think theyre looking into the atmospheres rn

People use /srs ironically which completely defeats the purpose


[10/28/2022 10:40 PM] 5298_
I keep seeing people say "I'm in your walls /srs" which is funny but it's still funny if you take away the /srs. I don't understand why people use things incorrectly. Like vaping, it's supposed to help with nicotine addictions but people use them without ever smoking before which defeats the purpose

[10/28/2022 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's so over-accepting that inequality is a thing still


[10/28/2022 10:56 PM] 5298_
Kids with Asperger's were people who could help the Nazis ( so people who had good memory or good at puzzles ect. ) and kids with autism were killed


[10/28/2022 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Asperger's is just another term for high-functioning autism


[10/28/2022 10:57 PM] 5298_
Yeah, if I get diagnosed with Asperger's I'm just going to say Autism because I don't like the idea of being branded as a nazi war machine


[10/28/2022 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Asperger's diagnosis is now Autism


[10/28/2022 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's been that way since 2013 or 2003


[10/28/2022 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i cant really remember


[10/28/2022 10:58 PM] 5298_
Some countries still diagnose Asperger's, I'm not sure which ones, it's mainly America probably


[10/28/2022 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[10/28/2022 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
School think's I have adhd and i think they said something about potentially being autistic but idk

[10/28/2022 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's hard to tell tho


[10/28/2022 10:59 PM] 5298_
Nevermind, in 2013 America removed Asperger's as an official diagnosis

4 planets with the potential of life, imagine if we lived in a solar system where three other planets had life

Wish mars and venus never died


[10/28/2022 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Venus probably had water oceans at some point


[10/28/2022 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Carbon runoff effect says alot about that


[10/28/2022 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mars also probably had water


[10/28/2022 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and since amino acids got to earth, what stopped them from getting to mars and venus


[10/28/2022 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
venus and earth were probably twins at some point


[10/28/2022 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[10/29/2022 12:53 AM] 5298_
I'll keep you updated on my sanity at every hour mark. I'm counting this as 1am's update


[10/29/2022 12:55 AM] 5298_
1am: I'm slightly tired but I think I can fight sleep off. I'm thinking about space so I'm pretty calm. We'll see how long this lasts, you'll hear from me again at 2am.


[10/29/2022 2:09 AM] 5298_
2am: the tiredness has begun to set in, my eyes long for rest but my brain yearns for stimuli. I'm trying to satiate  it whilst not letting my body shut me down because of nature. The quietness has begun to burrow itself deep within me and fester into an uneasiness that I might be the only person for a mile or two to be awake. You'll hear from me again at 3am.

[10/29/2022 3:02 AM] 5298_
3am: the tiredness is like a worm now, it crawls its way in and burrows deep inside my brain. I won't let it win. The boredom is starting to slowly creep up on me, looming over me like the shadow of an impending tempest ready to crack her whip of lightning and destroy everything she touches. The uneasiness spreads through me like a virus. I doubt many people in the whole town are awake. You'll hear from me again at 4 am


[10/29/2022 3:12 AM] 5298_
3am/2: I'm beginning to doubt I will make it. Black. That's all there is anymore. The blackness of my room disorientates me. The blackness of the night sky looms over me with all her infinite majesty masqueraded by foreign light. The blackness of the abyss we retreat to when unconscious calls my name, it beckons me from beyond my sight. Like a mother looking for her child it's urgent and warm; welcoming. I will try to ward off the mental mirages of majesty.

We must build it ourselves, we much gather the metals of revolution and fashion them into Armilites and gillded banners and into war drums and pipes that we shall play as we march to war with the enemy and take back our home from the evil tyrant of Britanny. WE MUST CUT DOWN THE TREE OF REVOLUTION AND CONSTRUCT HER WOOD INTO THE GUILLATINE TO EXECUTE BRITTANY!

Capitalism isn't that good


[11/01/2022 8:52 PM] 5298_
Capitalism takes away people joys and replaces them with the responsibility of money at the age of 10


[11/01/2022 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Youve been sounding very communisty recently


[11/01/2022 8:53 PM] 5298_
I'm not a communist I'm just also not a capitalist


[11/01/2022 8:53 PM] 5298_
I don't like globalism


[11/01/2022 8:54 PM] 5298_
And without globalism non-capitalism would work


[11/01/2022 8:54 PM] 5298_
But with globalisation it just can't


[11/01/2022 8:54 PM] 5298_
Capitalism is the best systems for countries not people


[11/01/2022 8:56 PM] 5298_
Honestly I would prefer to build my own home and grow my own food and provide for myself then work for an industry but I guess that goes deeper down into my anti-industrial revolution views


[11/01/2022 8:56 PM] 5298_
What are your opinions on this?


[11/01/2022 8:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not too sure


[11/01/2022 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
youd still be taxed though which is pretty shit


[11/01/2022 9:01 PM] 5298_
Surely building your home, growing your own food and aside from that not having barely any responsibilitys and having as much free time we you want to focus on fun and your passions is better than working for 8 hours to get barely anymoney to go back to a crappy flat where you barely have any food and have to choose between eating or not freezing somedays than having to sleep soon after so you can get up to repeat it for the next few years to come


[11/01/2022 9:01 PM] 5298_
Once again a fault of capatilism

[11/01/2022 9:02 PM] 5298_
Personally I wouldn't, as long as you remember about growing/ harvesting your food then you'll be fine

Do they not know other members of our genus excised?


[11/03/2022 7:17 PM] 5298_
The Uncanny Valley helped us recognise homosapiens from neanderthals and such


[11/03/2022 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/03/2022 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/03/2022 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
where do you think i could improve that


[11/03/2022 7:31 PM] 5298_
I think the phrase "it is presumed" is used too much


[11/03/2022 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What should i replace it with


[11/03/2022 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want the information in the level to evolve over time as it is explored too so not sure what i can add lmfao


[11/03/2022 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It is presumed is used twice


[11/03/2022 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
appears to be is used three times


[11/03/2022 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so replacing them should be hard


[11/03/2022 7:36 PM] 5298_
"They think" "it's thought*


[11/03/2022 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/03/2022 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/03/2022 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Since we both have very vivid imaginations, i think we could both work on this lmfao

The Dylan Project


[11/03/2022 8:14 PM] 5298_
I've been wanting to make my own mythology. We pick a natural thing, then we make a story about how that thing came about. If we think any character in the story is important enough we can add them to the pantheon


[11/03/2022 8:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Intriguing


[11/03/2022 8:15 PM] 5298_

[11/03/2022 8:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The Mulvey Mythology


[11/03/2022 8:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then we make a country and history and a lanugage


[11/03/2022 8:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
NOW WE HAVE DYLANISM


[11/03/2022 8:15 PM] 5298_
CUMBERLAND


[11/03/2022 8:16 PM] 5298_
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CUMBRIC WAS. WE MAKE THE LANGUAGE OF CUMBRIC AND AN ANCIENT HISTROY AND MYTHOLOGY OF THE LAND


[11/03/2022 8:16 PM] 5298_
And we can learn about our Celtic ancestors to make it authentic


[11/03/2022 8:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cumbrism


[11/03/2022 8:26 PM] 5298_
Should we start with the obvious, a creation myth


[11/03/2022 8:27 PM] 5298_
Do you want to read up about Irelands, I'll do Scottish and then we can tell each other what we find, and any similarities we can incorporate into our myth

boom


[11/03/2022 8:29 PM] 5298_

[11/03/2022 8:29 PM] 5298_

[11/03/2022 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I HAVE AN IDEA


[11/03/2022 8:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we make a branch of english but add new letters or replace letters


[11/03/2022 8:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so it should sound recognisable


[11/03/2022 8:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/03/2022 8:32 PM] 5298_
Like Scots?


[11/03/2022 8:32 PM] 5298_
Scots is very clearly related to English but is clearly a different language


[11/03/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Must more closely related


[11/03/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
literally english


[11/03/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but slightly different


[11/03/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We could take inspiration from the hawaiian alphabet


[11/03/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it sounds stupid


[11/03/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but its literally english with a few letters missing


[11/03/2022 8:34 PM] 5298_
Should we add some old English letters back like √Ü


[11/03/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/03/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i might make some new letters as well


[11/03/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it might sound nearly the same but written down it will be so much different lmao


[11/03/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

First Letter Proposal


[11/03/2022 8:38 PM] 5298_
How do you pronounce it?


[11/03/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Replace the PH sound like in Phonics


[11/03/2022 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Replaces


[11/03/2022 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So instead of Ph itd be that disgusting thing


[11/03/2022 8:39 PM] 5298_
Ysics


[11/03/2022 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What


[11/03/2022 8:39 PM] 5298_
Physics


[11/03/2022 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh yeah


[11/03/2022 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Silly ol me


[11/03/2022 8:40 PM] 5298_
It was the first ph word that came to mind


[11/03/2022 8:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/03/2022 8:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If a letter is duplicated


[11/03/2022 8:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like EE


[11/03/2022 8:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would be E with a line or circle above it


[11/03/2022 8:41 PM] 5298_
In cymraeg they have letters like that and it's just EE


[11/03/2022 8:41 PM] 5298_
That is the letter


[11/03/2022 8:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[11/03/2022 8:41 PM] 5298_
But we can do something different if we want, their way can be confusing

[11/03/2022 8:45 PM] 5298_
I guess it could be the creation myth


[11/03/2022 8:46 PM] 5298_
You know how when you shake a blanket it looks like it has hills and valleys and mountains


[11/03/2022 8:46 PM] 5298_
I want that to be how the world was made with its hills, valleys and mountains


[11/03/2022 8:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ja


[11/03/2022 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im using a piece of my little sisters fucking school work for this


[11/03/2022 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the back of it


[11/03/2022 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because i have no paper left


[11/03/2022 8:53 PM] 5298_
Will she not need that?


[11/03/2022 8:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nope


[11/03/2022 8:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She gave it to me like a fucking month ago


[11/03/2022 8:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/03/2022 8:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/03/2022 9:00 PM] 5298_
It looks Elvish


[11/03/2022 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It looks really similar to P though so should I put a line through it to distinguish it


[11/03/2022 9:01 PM] 5298_
One second

[11/03/2022 9:02 PM] 5298_
But make it look a bit more like thorn


[11/03/2022 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have


[11/03/2022 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am making some rules which dont necessarily make sense, but it distinguishes it from english


[11/03/2022 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"When a word in English begins with the letter A, followed by a consonant, it should become an E"


[11/03/2022 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Angelic becomes Engelic


[11/03/2022 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Still got changes dont worry


[11/03/2022 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if you want me to change anything


[11/03/2022 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmk


[11/03/2022 9:07 PM] 5298_
That's actually a really cool rule


[11/03/2022 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive got a letter for De


[11/03/2022 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill use d for now in placement for it


[11/03/2022 9:08 PM] 5298_
Epple sounds weird though


[11/03/2022 9:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
D is only used when a vowel comes after "de". E.g. Dear will become Dar


[11/03/2022 9:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We could make it sound a bit different


[11/03/2022 9:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not sure


[11/03/2022 9:08 PM] 5298_
That sounds German for some reason


[11/03/2022 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik


[11/03/2022 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i kinda want some german sounding shit but not really


[11/03/2022 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just something that sounds confusing


[11/03/2022 9:10 PM] 5298_
We could make the rest of the work harsh


[11/03/2022 9:10 PM] 5298_
So is goes from dear to daR


[11/03/2022 9:10 PM] 5298_
If that makes sense


[11/03/2022 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just like dar


[11/03/2022 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A new rule


[11/03/2022 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i made


[11/03/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If the ending letter to a word is c, if the previous letter was a vowel, then c becomes ch


[11/03/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have a letter for ch


[11/03/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Angelic to Engelich


[11/03/2022 9:13 PM] 5298_
It's so much different to English already I love it


[11/03/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
acidic to ecidich


[11/03/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Attic to ettich


[11/03/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it sounds cool now


[11/03/2022 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Actually there is 32 letters in our alphabet i forgot about the ph letter somehow


[11/03/2022 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How do you feel about O become an oh sound if it is followed be a vowel


[11/03/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Coat is now pronounced as Cot


[11/03/2022 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But then we could also make it so "ot" becomes oth


[11/03/2022 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So coat is pronounced as Coth


[11/03/2022 9:26 PM] 5298_
I much prefer Coth to Cot


[11/03/2022 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[11/03/2022 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And how about if the letter after a consonant is E then the consonant goes in front of it


[11/03/2022 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im liking our language so far


[11/03/2022 9:27 PM] 5298_
Give me an example


[11/03/2022 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Bike becomes Biek


[11/03/2022 9:27 PM] 5298_
Me too


[11/03/2022 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Would the pronunciation change though


[11/03/2022 9:27 PM] 5298_
Probably


[11/03/2022 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If c is the first letter of a word, followed by a vowel, then it becomes a K


[11/03/2022 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
consonant becomes Konsonant


[11/03/2022 9:28 PM] 5298_
Because an e at the end changes the pronunciation and the e isn't at the end anymore


[11/03/2022 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Bike would be pronounced as Beak?


[11/03/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How about bike just becomes beek when translated for no particular reason


[11/03/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which would follow the line rule btw


[11/03/2022 9:29 PM] 5298_
Bi-e-k


[11/03/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Sounds russian lmfao


[11/03/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[11/03/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
read it wrong


[11/03/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like that


[11/03/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How about the k at the end becomes ch too


[11/03/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or is that too much


[11/03/2022 9:30 PM] 5298_
I think that's too much


[11/03/2022 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[11/03/2022 9:30 PM] 5298_
I'm struggling to keep up anyways


[11/03/2022 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill write all the rules down somewhere online


[11/03/2022 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then make a font for our language


[11/03/2022 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we can make more rules later


[11/03/2022 9:31 PM] 5298_
How do names work in the language?


[11/03/2022 9:31 PM] 5298_
Names always confuse me in a language


[11/03/2022 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Names are the same as the language they are made from


[11/03/2022 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Rylan stays as rylan


[11/03/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dylan stays dylan


[11/03/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But we can always make changes


[11/03/2022 9:32 PM] 5298_
Yeah but if we made a name in the language


[11/03/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[11/03/2022 9:32 PM] 5298_
Because Rylan and Dylan are clearly Irish names so how do we make Cumbric names for our mythos


[11/03/2022 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good question


[11/03/2022 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We need to think about that


[11/03/2022 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Rylhen?


[11/03/2022 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Rilhen?


[11/03/2022 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dilhen?


[11/03/2022 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Riylhen?


[11/03/2022 9:35 PM] 5298_
I mean new names


[11/03/2022 9:35 PM] 5298_
Not translations


[11/03/2022 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[11/03/2022 9:36 PM] 5298_
Dylan is clearly Irish
Matthew is clearly English
Mei is clearly Chinese
What's a Cumbric name?


[11/03/2022 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We'll have to think about it


[11/03/2022 10:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/03/2022 10:47 PM] 5298_
Infront like always, we have so many rules I'm getting confused


[11/03/2022 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Should i list some in a moment


[11/03/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
And having the adjective after reminds me of the Fr**h and I don't want to think about them


[11/03/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/03/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
What do you think of him?


[11/03/2022 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant remember


[11/03/2022 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was a while ago


[11/03/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
I idolise him. I just think he's amazing. I have one of his books and it's once if my favourites I've watched all of his videos hundreds of times over, I've listened to his compositions and I've sent him an email telling him how much he means to me ( he's said in a different video that people should do this with people they idolise because before you know they're gone because a man he idolised and wanted to meet killed himself before he got the chance to meet him )


[11/03/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
I might be slightly obsessed


[11/03/2022 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907 (pinned)
Rules so far:
Repeated letters have a line over them.

D(e) is only used when a vowel comes after "de".

If a word starts with A, followed by a consonant, it should become an E.

If the endling letter to a word is c, and the previous letter is a vowel, it becomes C(h).

If c is the first letter of a word, followed  by a vowel, it becomes a K.

If an O is followed by a vowel, it makes an "Oh" sound.

If c is the first letter of a word, followed by a vowel, then it becomes a K.

If the letter after a consonant is E, then the consonant goes in front of it.

If a vowel is followed by another vowel, then the second vowel should be silent.

If a vowel is silent, it should be replaced with an apostrophe.

We need to make a full fucking dictonary of our new spellings with our new letter


[11/03/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/03/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is fine


[11/03/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

ree is the translation of are based on the rules

which could be shortened to how're you

[11/03/2022 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why is that


[11/03/2022 11:02 PM] 5298_
You know my girlfriend, well she broke up with me ( I don't want to get into it ) and a few months ago she got me this bracelet, the bracelet was completely ruined but I kept the pendant and was going to put it on a necklace but then she broke up with me so I turned the lights off and threw it so I couldn't find it again and then I went to sleep. When I woke up it was in the end of my bed. I did it again and I just found it on my blanket. Fate wants me to keep this but I don't want it


[11/03/2022 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO WTF


[11/03/2022 11:03 PM] 5298_

Knowing my luck a magpie will take it and nest on my roof, drop it and it will end up on my window sill


[11/03/2022 11:05 PM] 5298_
At this point I'll just keep it, it's a pretty cool pendant anyways

How to Create Your Own Constructed Language (Conlang) - LinguaVirtua
The beauty of language is that it is highly adaptable: they evolve as new generations come, words are added to a lexicon, and grammar rules are constantly adjusted. Furthermore, both professional linguists and language enthusiasts alike can construct an entirely new language of their own from scratch. Often referred to as conlangs (constructed l...

[11/03/2022 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
1. Decide how you want your language to ‚Äúsound‚Äù like
Start with your phonology‚Äîhow do you want your language to sound like? Draw inspiration from existing languages. 

For example, German and Arabic are generally harsh-sounding languages, while French and Italian sound ‚Äúsweeter‚Äù and more feminine.


[11/03/2022 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2. Determine your consonants and vowels
Your phonology goes hand in hand with your phonotactics‚Äîthe way consonants and vowels go together. 

It‚Äôs important to note that ‚Äúhard‚Äù languages are those that predominantly use guttural consonants such as /K/ and /G/ with fewer connecting vowels. ‚ÄúSoft‚Äù languages, on the other hand, tend to use more vowels than consonants.


[11/03/2022 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
3. Create your words
This is where language creation gets more fun: creating your own words or lexicon. 

With your phonology and phonotactics to guide you, you can derive your vocabulary from any language that makes sense to your conlang. For example, since the creators of the Dothraki wanted the language to sound harsh, many elements of the conlang were inspired by the Arabic language, including its vocabulary. 

Consider your syllables and stresses as well. For example, do some words change in terms of how it is inflected depending on the mood or context?


[11/03/2022 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
**WE SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE SOME VOWELS**


[11/03/2022 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Vowels are letters that make a noise for which you don't need have any contact in your mouth. Essentially noises that you make with only your throat. In all other letters, you move your lips or tongue or anything else.


[11/03/2022 11:14 PM] 5298_
I thought we were calling it Cumbric, also yes that would be amazing. Do you think she'll think we're having a stroke

Yes


[11/03/2022 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also xylophone


[11/03/2022 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Xy should be dropped

Xylophone

I thought of


[11/03/2022 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If a vowel is followed by another vowel, then the second vowel should be silent.

A traveller, I met


[11/03/2022 11:32 PM] 5298_
I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said‚Äî‚ÄúTwo vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.


[11/03/2022 11:32 PM] 5298_
That's English

If a vowel is silent, it should be replaced with an apostrophe.


[11/03/2022 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think


[11/03/2022 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
at least


[11/03/2022 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Tell me any issues you have whilst writing it out


[11/03/2022 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So i can sort the language out


[11/03/2022 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Rules so far:
Repeated letters have a line over them.

D(e) is only used when a vowel comes after "de".

If a word starts with A, followed by a consonant, it should become an E.

If the endling letter to a word is c, and the previous letter is a vowel, it becomes C(h).

If c is the first letter of a word, followed  by a vowel, it becomes a K.

If an O is followed by a vowel, it makes an "Oh" sound.

If c is the first letter of a word, followed by a vowel, then it becomes a K.

If the letter after a consonant is E, then the consonant goes in front of it.

If a vowel is followed by another vowel, then the second vowel should be silent.

If a vowel is silent, it should be replaced with an apostrophe.

I have a new idea

there is an apotstrophe before every suffix

The Irish creation myth is that there were no god's, no time and no humans but where the ocean met the shore a white hare was created from the foam, the white hare then had a child and some incest happened and we got the Irish pantheon then the hare left to the ocean

[11/03/2022 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And then we can make it audible later on down the line

I think we should follow etymology


[11/04/2022 12:07 AM] 5298_
Come up with basic words, figure out how we want them to be pronounced and then use those basic words to make new words and carry on until we have a full language

How to Make a Language - Part 2: Phonology
In this episode, we take a look at the basics of constructing a sound system, including phonetic inventory and phonotactics. 

If you're looking to learn more about phonology and sound systems, I strongly recommend Artifexian's IPA series, which examines the nuances of the IPA in much greater detail than this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch...

I think it should be a soft language because Celtic languages are soft


[11/04/2022 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes


[11/04/2022 12:09 AM] 5298_
I think we should meet up some day to discuss this this because it's difficult to do over text


[11/04/2022 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Making a new language whilst only being about to use the English language is difficult


[11/04/2022 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

dutch will be an inspiration for this language


[11/04/2022 12:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
English and Dutch also have their similarities in grammar, however, they do not come without some differences.

The Dutch verb system is similar to the English one although there are some exceptions. For example, the Dutch do not use the auxiliary in question or negations. So, a Dutch studying entry-level English may phrase a question in the following way: ‚ÄúWhere you come from?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow you like the food?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI drink not beer‚Äù. There is also no continuous tense in the Dutch language which can lead to translation errors like: ‚ÄúI ate a supper when you rang the bell‚Äù!

Another difference between the two languages is that English uses past simple in order to describe a past activity that started and ended in the past. Conversely, Dutch used the present perfect in order to express the same action.

Here is an example:

English ‚Äì  My cousin went to Spain last year. Dutch ‚Äì  My cousin has gone to Spain last year.

I have a very controversial opinion for you, arguably my most controversial opinion


[11/07/2022 12:12 AM] 5298_
Suicide isn't always a bad thing. I think we can agree that death isn't always a bad thing, if you have a terrible illness and you're in horrific pain and will be for the rest of your life then death might be the only way out. I think suicide - under the correct circumstances - can be a good thing, I think we can all agree if Dahmer killed himself before he started raping and eating teenagers the world would be a better place. If Hitler killed himself a decade earlier that wouldn't be sad. So certain people killing themselves for the right reasons can be good

We can work on Cumbric. I have my laptop back so we could call to talk about it if you want.


[11/07/2022 8:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Alright sir


[11/07/2022 8:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill call later


[11/07/2022 8:29 PM] 5298_
I won't be able to call after 9pm


[11/07/2022 8:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/07/2022 8:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was going to call in an hour


[11/07/2022 8:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I guess we shall do some discussioning her


[11/07/2022 8:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/07/2022 8:30 PM] 5298_
Yes sir


[11/07/2022 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im going afk in 5 mins i dont know how long ill be


[11/07/2022 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
probably 30 mins


[11/07/2022 8:31 PM] 5298_
I'll think about a way to make the language


[11/07/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You know the nomai language from outer wilds


[11/07/2022 8:32 PM] 5298_
Yes


[11/07/2022 8:32 PM] 5298_
I think it's wonderful


[11/07/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it is


[11/07/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I got the dlc today


[11/07/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i find it interesting


[11/07/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the language


[11/07/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But its only written


[11/07/2022 8:33 PM] 5298_
We could write our language in a similar fashion


[11/07/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was thinking about that


[11/07/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Except make it verbal


[11/07/2022 8:34 PM] 5298_
Well I have a plan for the verbal aspects but the written aspects can be like Nomai


[11/07/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ja


[11/07/2022 8:36 PM] 5298_
I'm thinking we start from the ground up. We make basic words and go from there, so we go from sky to sun to light to bright to dim to dusk to dawn


[11/07/2022 8:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ja


[11/07/2022 8:36 PM] 5298_
Do we want Cumbric to be harsh or soft?


[11/07/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not too sure


[11/07/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill have a think


[11/07/2022 8:37 PM] 5298_
I think soft because Celtic languages are typically soft


[11/07/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have returned


[11/07/2022 9:12 PM] 5298_
Hello Rylan


[11/07/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cumbrick


[11/07/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Shall we construct it


[11/07/2022 9:14 PM] 5298_
Yes


[11/07/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Poo


[11/07/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lets go


[11/07/2022 9:14 PM] 5298_
We need basic words and then go from there


[11/07/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Id say we need to pick the sounds to use


[11/07/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then we give those sounds a character


[11/07/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then we construct words


[11/07/2022 9:15 PM] 5298_
I was thinking we construct basic words, then pick sounds from those words to go into other words and go from there if that makes sense


[11/07/2022 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We could use a sound generator thingy


[11/07/2022 9:16 PM] 5298_
Maybe


[11/07/2022 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lets choose some vowels


[11/07/2022 9:20 PM] 5298_
A
E
I
O
U
Y
K
R


[11/07/2022 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How should words be constructed


[11/07/2022 9:23 PM] 5298_
The more basic the word the shorter, so simple ideas like sky and land are very small when more complicated ideas like surgery and physics are longer because those concepts come later in a languages life


[11/07/2022 9:25 PM] 5298_
Language follows human achievement, newer words are based around newer concepts and if we're having a built upon language where parts of words make other words then more complicated words will be longer because they're talking many concepts from many words


[11/07/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Should we use the same sounds as irish gaelic


[11/07/2022 9:32 PM] 5298_
Yes


[11/07/2022 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Now we shall create some characters


[11/07/2022 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wait


[11/07/2022 9:34 PM] 5298_
Using Irish sounds will be easier because I have a whole book about Irish and it makes sense entomology wise because Cumberland is so close to Ireland they would have definitely blended together


[11/07/2022 9:35 PM] 5298_
Just the same as how Scots sounds so close to English because they mixed

thats the output based on sound


[11/07/2022 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the pattern is the generator's default of CV(CV)N


[11/07/2022 9:38 PM] 5298_
What does that even say


[11/07/2022 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its a bunch of ipa letters


[11/07/2022 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the sounds themselves


[11/07/2022 9:38 PM] 5298_
Oh


[11/07/2022 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its just the irish-gaelic letters


[11/07/2022 9:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
This pattern, in Irish Gaelic, is called ‚ÄúCaol le caol, leathan le leathan‚Äù. Let me explain: If the vowels ‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúo‚Äù or ‚Äúu‚Äù are immediately followed by one or more consonants, then any vowel immediately following those consonants will also be ‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúo‚Äù, or ‚Äúu


[11/07/2022 9:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill use that


[11/07/2022 9:40 PM] 5298_
I don't really understand, languages aren't really my thing


[11/07/2022 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If a, o, or u are followed by a consonant or more


[11/07/2022 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then any vowel after those will also be a o u


[11/07/2022 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
same goes for the rest of the vowels


[11/07/2022 9:41 PM] 5298_

Anyways


[11/07/2022 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
now that we have sounds


[11/07/2022 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we need to make characters


[11/07/2022 9:55 PM] 5298_
I'm not sure how we do that


[11/07/2022 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
doesnt have to be anything specific


[11/07/2022 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill throw some together in a sec

[11/07/2022 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
heres where im getting sounds from


[11/07/2022 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
basically its just the sound but without the -ah thing they add at the end


[11/07/2022 10:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have an idea


[11/07/2022 10:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it can have a gaelic pronunciation


[11/07/2022 10:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but we can have weird shapes as the actual characters

Yes


[11/07/2022 10:18 PM] 5298_
Base 4 I think


[11/07/2022 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Base 20 it says


[11/07/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

The first is descended from apple


[11/07/2022 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Second from eel


[11/07/2022 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
third from eye


[11/07/2022 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fourth for owl


[11/07/2022 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
(all things that can 100% be found in cumbria)


[11/07/2022 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im dropping the last vowel


[11/07/2022 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

They all look really cool


[11/07/2022 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Easy way to remember


[11/07/2022 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Apple, Eel, Eye, Owl, Underwater


[11/07/2022 10:39 PM] 5298_
I just realized they all look like those things


[11/07/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yep


[11/07/2022 10:39 PM] 5298_
Save for underwater I don't see that one


[11/07/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Extremely simplified


[11/07/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I could do another zig zag


[11/07/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but itd be similar to Eel


[11/07/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
basically


[11/07/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
waterline


[11/07/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then the sun


[11/07/2022 10:40 PM] 5298_
It looks like a scope


[11/07/2022 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
although i could just remove the line


[11/07/2022 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
going through the middle


[11/07/2022 10:40 PM] 5298_
Change the top line to a small circle

Now it looks like the sea and sun


[11/07/2022 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm going to put the notches on the sides


[11/07/2022 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
since we arent doing a vertical language


[11/07/2022 10:43 PM] 5298_
Aren't we basing it off of Nomai though?


[11/07/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I changed my mind


[11/07/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we're just doing our own


[11/07/2022 10:43 PM] 5298_
Ah


[11/07/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nomai is just swirls and shit


[11/07/2022 10:44 PM] 5298_
It's cool but it doesn't make any sense


[11/07/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes

[11/07/2022 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Hyroglyphic, but much easier to write and understand

[11/08/2022 1:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I forgot c


[11/08/2022 1:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Since c is missing, we can use k


[11/08/2022 1:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So crack is krak


[11/08/2022 1:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should put a line above repeated letters too


[11/08/2022 1:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So in Apple, it becomes Aple


[11/08/2022 1:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Yes

[11/08/2022 6:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Honestly im not too sure


[11/08/2022 6:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's one of the noises listed on the irish gaelic ipa wiki


[11/08/2022 6:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It sounds ny


[11/08/2022 6:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
…£ is the sound i forgot


[11/08/2022 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nvm i did it


[11/08/2022 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its literally just g


[11/08/2022 6:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Should i add √¶ back


[11/08/2022 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Night could be


[11/08/2022 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nikht


[11/08/2022 6:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the ight ending could be ikht


[11/08/2022 6:40 PM] 5298_
Is the k silent like in knife?


[11/08/2022 6:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not too sure


[11/08/2022 6:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fight becomes fikht


[11/08/2022 6:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lets not have it silent to give it some distinguishesoiaosioyion from english


[11/08/2022 6:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
speaking of english


[11/08/2022 6:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what if that becomes Anglikht


[11/08/2022 6:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or inglikht


[11/08/2022 6:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because the en in english sounds like in


[11/08/2022 6:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not english


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why did i put ikht


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] 5298_
I like Anglikht because most languages refer to England as some variation of Anglicans


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Alright


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Anglikht


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ikht can stick


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Anglikht


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Anglikht


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Anglikht


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I LOVE THAT WORD


[11/08/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
THAT WORD IS GOOD


[11/08/2022 6:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel like √¶ should be a determiner


[11/08/2022 6:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
instead of the it could be √¶


[11/08/2022 6:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Irish has A as a male determiner and e with a tilda as a female determiner


[11/08/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
should ours be √¶ and e


[11/08/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And put e at the end of words (ik the french did it but)


[11/08/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
also it overcomplicates things


[11/08/2022 6:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we could also use that to insult the english


[11/08/2022 6:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we could call them Anglikhte because we hate them and calling something a little girl is like an insult


[11/08/2022 6:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would also be silent


[11/08/2022 6:51 PM] 5298_
Hmmmm, I'm not sure


[11/08/2022 6:52 PM] 5298_
Gendered language is pointless in my eyes but I do like bullying the English


[11/08/2022 6:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[11/08/2022 6:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It also distinguishes a bit from english


[11/08/2022 6:52 PM] 5298_
True


[11/08/2022 6:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im gonna add y but its gonna send like uh

[11/08/2022 6:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats great


[11/08/2022 6:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I find that helpful because if we need to add a letter or change how it looks we can just pull one of the monsters names

We should probably remove the -ikht ending


[11/08/2022 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
since Enlight would translate to nearly the same thing


[11/08/2022 7:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think we;re doing a gendered language

I've figured it out


[11/08/2022 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/08/2022 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Ka'aple (the apple)


[11/08/2022 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If something is determining a word, they should be joined by an apostrophe


[11/08/2022 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
adjectives should also be joined to the noun they're describing with an apostrophe

Before the great mountains and vast oceans of the world there was only a night. This night was called Nikht and it was ruled by an emperor of the same name. Nikht and his wife together conceived the realm of Nikht. They then conceived the moon and all the stars to decorate their new realm but there was a fault with the moon, it started to melt. The dew of the moon formed a tall white stag.


[11/08/2022 9:25 PM] 5298_
eventually I'll write that the reason eclipses happen is to stop the moon from melting but we don't even have the day yet


[11/08/2022 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/08/2022 9:28 PM] 5298_

Before the great mountains and vast oceans of the world there was only a night. This night was called Nikht and it was ruled by an emperor of the same name. Nikht and his wife together conceived the realm of Nikht. They then conceived the moon and all the stars to decorate their new realm but there was a fault with the moon, it started to melt. The dew of the moon formed a tall white stag called Motstahm. Motstahm was so cold that he kicked and ran to warm himself, leaving great footprints on the moon as he did so. Doing this, Motstahm got so warm that his antlers began to glow and lit up half of Nikht. This new part of Nikht was called Dayg. Still, Motstahms‚Äôs antlers were so bright they made a flaming entity also called Dayg. Sufficiently warm, Motstahm travelled back to the moon but Dayg wanted to stay with her father and chased after him but was too slow to catch him, to this day Dayg chases Motstahm wanting her father.


[11/08/2022 9:51 PM] 5298_
this is how we got Nikht and Dayg


[11/08/2022 9:51 PM] 5298_

You probably don't give a shit about Doctor Who but I thought this was interesting, this is from 1976 and in 2014 he became the 15th actor to betray The Doctor in his favourite childhood show

[11/10/2022 11:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it nearly killed itself once


[11/10/2022 11:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i thought it broke every bone in its body but apparently it didnt and got away with a few cuts lmfao


[11/10/2022 11:40 PM] 5298_
Could a snake hang itself with its own body?


[11/10/2022 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It could but i doubt it would work


[11/10/2022 11:40 PM] 5298_
I completely forgot snakes had bones


[11/10/2022 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/10/2022 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it had this skull hide


[11/10/2022 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and the nose slits were probably about quarter the size of her body


[11/10/2022 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was a baby bull skull replica hide


[11/10/2022 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then she tried to go through


[11/10/2022 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but got herself stuck


[11/10/2022 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and she started freaking out


[11/10/2022 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then she stopped reacting


[11/10/2022 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but my mam came and got her to pull herself out


[11/10/2022 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and she lives


[11/10/2022 11:41 PM] 5298_

[11/10/2022 11:48 PM] 5298_

Growing Human Neurons Connected to a Computer
Neurons are amazing little microbes capable of learning and making decisions. Modern AI tries to take inspiration from living neurons, but why settle for the synthetic version? By growing human neurons directly connected to a computer it's possible to make a living AI of sorts capable of even complex tasks like flying a plane in a simulation.

and all they can do is think


[11/11/2022 12:56 AM] 5298_

[11/11/2022 1:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
An analogue of a tiny, expanding universe has been created out of extremely cold potassium atoms. It could be used to help us understand cosmic phenomena that are exceedingly difficult to directly detect, such as pairs of particles that may be created out of empty space as the universe expands.

Markus Oberthaler at Heidelberg University in Germany and his colleagues cooled more than 20,000 potassium atoms in a vacuum, using lasers to slow them down and lower their temperature to about 60 nanokelvin, or 60 billionths of a degree kelvin above absolute zero.

At this temperature, the atoms formed a cloud about the width of a human hair and, instead of freezing, they became a quantum, fluid-like phase of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate. Atoms in this phase can be controlled by shining light on them ‚Äì using a tiny projector, the researchers precisely set the atoms‚Äô density, arrangement in space and the forces they exert on each other.

By changing these properties, the team made the atoms follow an equation called a space-time metric, which, in an actual, full-scale universe, determines how curved it is, how fast light travels and how much light must bend near very massive objects. This is the first experiment that has used cold atoms to simulate a curved and expanding universe, says Oberthaler.


[11/11/2022 1:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When the researchers used their projector to make atoms mimic an expanding universe, the atoms moved in exactly the kind of ripple pattern that would be expected if pairs of particles were popping into existence ‚Äì a phenomenon called particle pair production. The researchers say this suggests that the particle pairs can be produced in an expanding universe, like our own.

Alessio Celi at the Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain says that the new experiment is a very precise playground for putting together quantum effects and gravity. Physicists don‚Äôt quite know how the two combine in the universe we live in, but experiments with ultracold atoms may let them try out some ideas, and they could inspire new targets for observations in our much larger and more complex cosmos, he says.

Stefan Floerchinger at the University of Jena in Germany, who was part of the research team, says that future experiments with the same system could lead to a better understanding of quantum properties of our universe.


[11/11/2022 1:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They became quantum too


[11/11/2022 1:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dylan


[11/11/2022 1:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
this is cool but fucking horrifying


[11/11/2022 1:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we made a universe


[11/11/2022 1:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we made blackholes


[11/11/2022 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
DYLAN


[11/11/2022 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If this is actually a universe


[11/11/2022 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
doesnt that mean the multiverse theory is proven?


[11/11/2022 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im not sure whether you could class it as a universe


[11/11/2022 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but if you could, could it be the multiverse?


[11/11/2022 1:02 AM] 5298_
Technically, it's a different type of it but it's still multiverse


[11/11/2022 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its a universe within a univrese


[11/11/2022 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
universe*


[11/11/2022 1:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
this is vice so its not the best source

[11/11/2022 1:04 AM] 5298_
Why are we making universes when we don't even understand this one?


[11/11/2022 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was thinking


[11/11/2022 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that


[11/11/2022 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should try to understand consciousness


[11/11/2022 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
At least


[11/11/2022 1:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
before saying we understand this one


[11/11/2022 1:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which we dont


[11/11/2022 1:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we barely know anything


[11/11/2022 1:05 AM] 5298_
Although, if we make a real working universe surely that is the answer to the origins of the universe


[11/11/2022 1:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats true


[11/11/2022 1:05 AM] 5298_
Oh no. Not the hard problem of consciousness


[11/11/2022 1:05 AM] 5298_
That question gives me nightmares


[11/11/2022 1:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It does


[11/11/2022 1:06 AM] 5298_
It's the hardest question I've ever been asked


[11/11/2022 1:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's the hardest question the Human Race has asked


[11/11/2022 1:07 AM] 5298_
Yes and I hate it


[11/11/2022 1:08 AM] 5298_
We're closer to (dis)proving the existence of God then we are to understanding consciousness and that's terrifying


[11/11/2022 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm scared that God is just the alien who created the Universe, who is on a major powertrip


[11/11/2022 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not to mention he seems like a knobhead


[11/11/2022 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he sounds like the US


[11/11/2022 1:09 AM] 5298_
We don't understand the tool that created an entire fucking universe


[11/11/2022 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe theyre connected


[11/11/2022 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he imprisoned one of his major opponents


[11/11/2022 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
(sounds like the us and russia)


[11/11/2022 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because it could change the balance of power


[11/11/2022 1:10 AM] 5298_
Joe Biden is God [CONFIRMED NOT CLICKBAIT]


[11/11/2022 1:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/11/2022 1:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it sounds like it though


[11/11/2022 1:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dylan


[11/11/2022 1:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Want me to hurt your brain a little bit mroe


[11/11/2022 1:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
more


[11/11/2022 1:11 AM] 5298_
Wait, if the US is God and Columbus founded the US ( kinda ) then does that mean that God is an insane man that fucked a manatee?


[11/11/2022 1:11 AM] 5298_
Go on


[11/11/2022 1:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The fact that there are reports of Out of Body experiences baffles me


[11/11/2022 1:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope that I get one when I die so, even if you do go unconscious not too long after death (assuming my brain isn't destroyed by something such as a gun), one of my dead relatives gets to speak to me for a bit and take me to the land of rest.


[11/11/2022 1:14 AM] 5298_
That's actually really nice


[11/11/2022 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know


[11/11/2022 1:15 AM] 5298_
I hope God isn't real


[11/11/2022 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I also hope God isnt real


[11/11/2022 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i hope theres an after life so I can speak to my dead relatives


[11/11/2022 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that would be cool


[11/11/2022 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but then id meet people from the fucking cave men era


[11/11/2022 1:15 AM] 5298_
Because God is a mind and understanding a mind is so much harder than understanding laws


[11/11/2022 1:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not even christians understand god


[11/11/2022 1:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or jews


[11/11/2022 1:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or muslims


[11/11/2022 1:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Some say its a person


[11/11/2022 1:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
some say its a spirit


[11/11/2022 1:17 AM] 5298_
This first thing I'd do is find Edison and kick him in the dick then find Newton and just listen to him for hours


[11/11/2022 1:18 AM] 5298_
Newton is my favourite person to have ever lived


[11/11/2022 1:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im moving my family tree to something that is not ancestry


[11/11/2022 1:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because ancestry is greedy as fuck


[11/11/2022 1:19 AM] 5298_
They should have named it ancestree


[11/11/2022 1:19 AM] 5298_
Because it's a family tree


[11/11/2022 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/11/2022 1:21 AM] 5298_
If I ever find out that Newton was like pro-slavery or something I think I'd just kill myself


[11/11/2022 1:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wouldnt be surprised


[11/11/2022 1:21 AM] 5298_
It's seventeenth century England slavery was abolished


[11/11/2022 1:22 AM] 5298_
Nevermind I'm dumb


[11/11/2022 1:22 AM] 5298_
Nineteenth century is when it was abolished how did I forget that


[11/11/2022 1:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/11/2022 1:25 AM] 5298_
Newton was smarter than Einstein and anyone who says different is a fucking idiot


[11/11/2022 1:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/11/2022 1:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
FUCK


[11/11/2022 1:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IM THAT TIRED


[11/11/2022 1:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
THAT I THOUGHT NEWTON WAS FUCKING NICHOLAS TESLA UNTIL I THOUGHT OF THE TESLA COIL


[11/11/2022 1:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
SO I WAS CONFUSED


[11/11/2022 1:27 AM] 5298_
If we're going off IQ, Newton is assumed to have an IQ of 200 and Einstein had an estimated 160


[11/11/2022 1:27 AM] 5298_
SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ELECTRICITY


[11/11/2022 1:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
YES


[11/11/2022 1:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
imagine


[11/11/2022 1:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what the world would be like if the romans had electricity


[11/11/2022 1:28 AM] 5298_
Far more advanced


[11/11/2022 1:28 AM] 5298_
Or destroyed


[11/11/2022 1:28 AM] 5298_
Either one


[11/11/2022 1:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I would like to go back to the topic of the afterlife


[11/11/2022 1:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because they claim it a lot of it to be DMT


[11/11/2022 1:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the shit that makes you dream and trip and what not


[11/11/2022 1:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Which makes sense for the most part


[11/11/2022 1:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but some doctors put words in cupboards or hidden places, places that a patient shouldnt see in, in case they die


[11/11/2022 1:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then when the patient has an out of body experience, but is revived


[11/11/2022 1:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they ask about the words


[11/11/2022 1:31 AM] 5298_
That would explain why people who have died have said they saw what they believed, because when you dream you dream about things you already know but altered


[11/11/2022 1:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not to mention the reports of people who reported an out of body experience and were able to describe perfectly what happened


[11/11/2022 1:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We'll only find out when we ide


[11/11/2022 1:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
die


[11/11/2022 1:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my nana died for a couple of seconds but was revived and said it was just black


[11/11/2022 1:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
shes still alive btw


[11/11/2022 1:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which is scary,


[11/11/2022 1:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and theres lots of reports of it just being black


[11/11/2022 1:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but theres been 2 people who went brain dead shortly who were brought back


[11/11/2022 1:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the first article on the first person was removed not sure why


[11/11/2022 1:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill try find it


[11/11/2022 1:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant fucking find it


[11/11/2022 1:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But if its true


[11/11/2022 1:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
she said there was something


[11/11/2022 1:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cant remember specifics


[11/11/2022 1:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and said she cant wait to go back


[11/11/2022 1:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so it must be good if there is something


[11/11/2022 1:35 AM] 5298_
Imagine you're the person asking her about what she saw and she says "I don't know but I really want to die"


[11/11/2022 1:36 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmao


[11/11/2022 1:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im not sure where i stand on the afterlife stuff


[11/11/2022 1:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
everything sounds equally amazing and terrifying


[11/11/2022 1:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i used to be scared of dying but now i could care less


[11/11/2022 1:41 AM] 5298_
I flip between finding it terrifying and not caring


[11/11/2022 1:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
from early 2020-early this year I was so scared of dying in my sleep that I would struggle to sleep sometimes


[11/11/2022 1:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That was my enlightment phase i think


[11/11/2022 1:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Now if i die i die


[11/11/2022 1:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont care


[11/11/2022 1:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just want to prove something


[11/11/2022 1:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have a plan in case i die at a very young age


[11/11/2022 1:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im going to write a note


[11/11/2022 1:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
(i will hide the note in a nearly-random place)


[11/11/2022 1:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
based on a few factors


[11/11/2022 1:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If visitation dreams are real


[11/11/2022 1:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill visit my mum and tell her where it is


[11/11/2022 1:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
boom


[11/11/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and on that note


[11/11/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there will be nuclear launch codes


[11/11/2022 1:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and the words run or hide in rushed writing


[11/11/2022 1:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that is a joke


[11/11/2022 1:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im tired so im thinking of random shit


[11/11/2022 1:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that makes no sense


[11/11/2022 1:45 AM] 5298_
Everything will have been. There will be a time when nothing new will ever happen. Everything that has ever happened will all melt together into the silent cacophony, the unblinking pupil. The mass of everything, the great mystery. This will happen. And you won‚Äôt exist. Your history and future will be forgotten, incinerated and lost. We won‚Äôt be. The God that rules the heavens and breathes life into all; will destroy us and kill herself in a glory of colour. The Earth's losses and victories, her parasite that rules over her with complete dominion that has crafted a history and future for itself will be destroyed with nothing left. We call this mortality. The notion that one will die is terrifying for most, and debilitating for some. But mortality is not just the notion that one will die, it is the notion that their kinship will die, their friends, enemies, communities, future. Everything that will ever be will die. This can be a horrific notion. Mortality is a sickening word that infects us all. Some try to cheat it with a legacy, this too is fleeting. for when the people that know this legacy die and the statues fall and the books decay, so too will that legacy. A legacy is a mortal man extending his life, not negating death, just prolonging it until after they rot. Then everything will rot and none of this will matter. 

I wrote this a little while ago and I thought it was fitting for the conversation


[11/11/2022 1:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It is


[11/11/2022 1:46 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Robertus jaggard definitely isnt dead if his potential fifteen great grandchild knows he existed


[11/11/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe im just depressed at the moment lmfao


[11/11/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i dont feel depressed


[11/11/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i feel normally


[11/11/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Normal


[11/11/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
UFCKING HELL IM KNACKERED


[11/11/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
brb im gonna get a drink


[11/11/2022 1:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
BACK


[11/11/2022 1:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nothing matters permanently, only temporarily


[11/11/2022 1:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im scared of myself


[11/11/2022 1:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not even going to lie


[11/11/2022 1:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The funeral I attended today was for one of my relatives


[11/11/2022 1:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and I knew he was going to die, I always had a feeling


[11/11/2022 1:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I got the same feeling with my nana


[11/11/2022 1:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I knew she was going to die


[11/11/2022 1:51 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The night before he died, october 28th, I felt happy but knew something was off


[11/11/2022 1:51 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was too good to be true


[11/11/2022 1:51 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had the feeling for months prior


[11/11/2022 1:51 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe half a year


[11/11/2022 1:51 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its horrifying


[11/11/2022 1:52 AM] 5298_
Are you okay?


[11/11/2022 1:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/11/2022 1:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but I cant stop thinking about how I knew it was coming


[11/11/2022 1:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Of course it wouldnt of changed anything


[11/11/2022 1:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
have


[11/11/2022 1:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If i had said something


[11/11/2022 1:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but yaeh


[11/11/2022 1:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yeah


[11/11/2022 1:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats all i have to say about that


[11/11/2022 1:53 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dylan


[11/11/2022 1:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What if im just going schizophrenic lmao


[11/11/2022 1:56 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think i might be


[11/11/2022 1:56 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im not even lying


[11/11/2022 1:57 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
scientific breakthrough


[11/11/2022 1:58 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
schizo rylan era


[11/11/2022 1:59 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or im just tired


[11/11/2022 1:59 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
more probably explanation


[11/11/2022 1:59 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 2:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so thats very fun


[11/11/2022 2:27 AM] 5298_
I need to get good grades or I'm fucked


[11/11/2022 2:27 AM] 5298_
There is no part time job in the world I can take, I can't deal with loud noises or crowds so literally everything is off the table


[11/11/2022 2:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We're ever so slightly different


[11/11/2022 2:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate loud noises


[11/11/2022 2:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but


[11/11/2022 2:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i can handle them


[11/11/2022 2:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i hate crowds though


[11/11/2022 2:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and socialising unless its with a friend or family


[11/11/2022 2:28 AM] 5298_
I _can_ deal with loud noises but I choose not to and most times I get away with it


[11/11/2022 2:29 AM] 5298_
They're fucking horrendous and most times give me panic attacks


[11/11/2022 2:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Loud noises can induce panic and panic attacks in me


[11/11/2022 2:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The fire alarm at school is an instance of a loud noise i can handle for some reason


[11/11/2022 2:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i cant handle any loud noises that sound any bit distressing though


[11/11/2022 2:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Babies crying makes me panic


[11/11/2022 2:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Screaming or shouting


[11/11/2022 2:30 AM] 5298_
I used to get warnings in my old school when we had a drill so I didn't just fucking die


[11/11/2022 2:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Although i scream and shout my school


[11/11/2022 2:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wtf did i write


[11/11/2022 2:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
although i scream and shout all the time not my school lmao


[11/11/2022 2:31 AM] 5298_
When I'm public I have to leave when a kid starts screeching


[11/11/2022 2:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WHAT THE FUCK


[11/11/2022 2:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
PATRICK DALY MOVED TO AMERICA?


[11/11/2022 2:32 AM] 5298_
It's annoying when I'm in a shop because if I'm looking for something I don't get the chance to become someone is screeching


[11/11/2022 2:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Loud noises can disturb me


[11/11/2022 2:32 AM] 5298_
PADDY DALY DID WHAT


[11/11/2022 2:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but they also make me lose focus and track of what im doing


[11/11/2022 2:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 2:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 2:34 AM] 5298_
I was really confused because he was born 30 years after the famine and that's the only good reason to ever move to America, if you're literally going to starve to death if you don't


[11/11/2022 2:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Itd be pretty helpful if in the us census it showed where they arrived from


[11/11/2022 2:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im sure my family's dalys arent the only dalys


[11/11/2022 2:35 AM] 5298_
Which is worse, the US or En****d

[11/11/2022 2:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think it was nice


[11/11/2022 2:39 AM] 5298_
I mean modern Salford, WW2 era anywhere wasn't nice


[11/11/2022 2:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Great depression era id say


[11/11/2022 2:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was 1941 when she was evacuated

[11/11/2022 2:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 2:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 2:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 2:42 AM] 5298_
Why is your family full of micro-celebrities


[11/11/2022 2:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 2:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[11/11/2022 2:44 AM] 5298_
My Grandad wouldn't tell his children any of it except for the fact they're awful and beat him so my dad can only tell me the same


[11/11/2022 2:44 AM] 5298_
I want to see if any of my family were freedom fighters or fled to the US or did anything special


[11/11/2022 2:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My dad and nana are lucky fuckers


[11/11/2022 2:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they can become irish citizens whenever they want


[11/11/2022 2:45 AM] 5298_
I think it would be funny if literally no one in my family is famous of any degree


[11/11/2022 2:45 AM] 5298_
I can do that


[11/11/2022 2:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 3:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 3:19 AM] 5298_

They give barely any plorts and you can't get the vacuum that sucks all the plorts up so you end up throwing the fuckers around whilst vaccing the plorts and you need to get them back in before they leave and kill themselves

I was comatose for 8 hours


[11/11/2022 12:32 PM] 5298_
I got two hours of sleep


[11/11/2022 12:32 PM] 5298_
Then my mother rudely woke me up, then I got three more hours of sleep but I kept waking up because the dog was barking


[11/11/2022 12:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'll be on computing device soon


[11/11/2022 12:37 PM] 5298_
I am on my electronic device typically used for entertainment mainly playing video games, which the device gets its name from

[11/11/2022 3:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/11/2022 3:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its all fucking gray

You know the shit show coronation street


[11/11/2022 5:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/11/2022 5:07 PM] 5298_
It has 60 seasons and 10,230 episodes


[11/11/2022 5:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WHAT THE FUCK


[11/11/2022 5:08 PM] 5298_
ITS BEING GOING FOR 60 YEARS


[11/11/2022 5:08 PM] 5298_
HOW DO YOU GET 60 YEARS OUT OF ONE SHOW


[11/11/2022 5:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A SEASON A YEAR


[11/11/2022 5:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WTF


[11/11/2022 5:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
60


[11/11/2022 5:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
SEASONS


[11/11/2022 5:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ITS NOT EVEN THAT GOOD


[11/11/2022 5:10 PM] 5298_
If every episode is 25 minutes long ( which is my lowest estimate, a lot of them will be four times that amount ) that's 4,262.5 hours of show or 177.6 days or 25.3 weeks of show


[11/11/2022 5:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fucking hell


[11/11/2022 5:12 PM] 5298_
To watch the entirety of Coronation street you would have to sit down and without any breaks what so ever watch that show for 25 weeks straight


[11/11/2022 5:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
itd be shit for the first 30-40 seasons because of the quality


[11/11/2022 5:12 PM] 5298_
All of it is shit, Rylan


[11/11/2022 5:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/11/2022 5:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i mean even shitter


[11/11/2022 5:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Shit and shitter


[11/11/2022 5:13 PM] 5298_
Watching all of Coronation street would take about the same time as walking from the U.K. to Russia and back

It was far across the sea, when the devil got a hold of me
He wouldn't set me free, so he kept me soul for ransom
Na na na na na...

I'm a sailor man from Glasgow town
I've sailed this world around and round
He's the meanest thing that I have found
In all me days of wandering
Na na na na na....

Here we go again, we're on the road again
We're on the road again, we're on the way to paradise
We love the jungle deep, that's where the lion sleeps
For then those evil eyes, they have no place in paradise
Graffiti on the walls, just as the sun was going down
I see graffiti on the walls - for the Celts! for the Celts!
Graffiti on the walls says we're magic, we're magic
Graffiti on the wall.............................

It says oh ah up the 'RA, say ooh ah up the 'RA

We went thru each jungle deep
For the paradise that we did seek
Twas no trip for the weak
We're waltzing with the natives
Around in circles every way
He turned to me and he did say
"I think you're leading me astray
I want your soul, me boyo!"
Na na na na na

Here we go again, we're on the road again
We're on the road again, we're on the way to paradise
We love the jungle deep, that's where the lion sleeps
For then those evil eyes, they have no place in paradise

Graffiti on the walls, just as the sun was going down
I see graffiti on the walls - for the Celts! for the Celts!
Graffiti on the walls says we're magic, we're magic
Graffiti on the wall.............................

It says oh ah up the 'RA, say ooh ah up the 'RA

wtf is that


[11/12/2022 1:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Kazakhstan, greatest country in the world
All other countries are run by little girls
Kazakhstan, number one exporter of potassium
All other countries have inferior potassium

Kazakhstan, home of Tinshein swimming pool
It's length thirty meter, width six meter
Filtration system a marvel to behold
It remove 80% of human solid waste

Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, you very nice place
From plains of Tarashek to northern fence of Jewtown
Kazakhstan friend of all except Uzbekistan
They very nosey people, with bone in their brain

Kazakhstan, industry best in world
We invented toffee and trouser belt
Kazakhstan's prostitutes, cleanest in the region
Except of course for Turkmenistan's

Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, you very nice place
From plains of Tarashek to northern fence of Jewtown
Come grasp mighty penis of our leader
From junction with the testes to tip of its face!

why would i want a single generation to go extinct

No, it would take one generation to make the entire human race extinct

Anti-Natalism is the belief that humans should stop reproducing to make us go extinct

[11/12/2022 1:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
why did she write about the men she shagged


[11/12/2022 11:53 AM] 5298_
Because it was 1971 and she was LGBT so the way she interacted with men was unheard of then

[11/12/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/12/2022 9:22 PM] 5298_
I was awake for 31 hours and when I slept I was asleep for 21 hours

[11/12/2022 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IN TERMS OF STARS AND SHIT YES


[11/12/2022 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING ELSE


[11/12/2022 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
PROBABLY NOT


[11/12/2022 9:28 PM] 5298_
I MEAN THE COOPERATIVE VIDEO GAME FROM 2021 WHERE YOU AND A FRIEND ARE ON A SPACE STATION AND YOU HAVE TO MANAGE IT


[11/12/2022 9:29 PM] 5298_
I'M PISSED OFF


[11/12/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
NOPE


[11/12/2022 9:29 PM] 5298_
IT'S THE FREE GAME ON PLAYSTATION THIS MONTH BUT IT ISN'T CROSS PLAY


[11/12/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IT ALSO QUITE A BIT OF MONEY


[11/12/2022 9:29 PM] 5298_
¬£17


[11/12/2022 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dylan


[11/12/2022 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think we should terraform venus


[11/12/2022 9:31 PM] 5298_
Rylan


[11/12/2022 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it might take a while


[11/12/2022 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but its better than mars


[11/12/2022 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and potentially easier


[11/12/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you just need a way to reverse the carbon runoff effect so the oceans return


[11/12/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Then


[11/12/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the atmosphere will be potentially much more habitable and liveable


[11/12/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
itd just be a warmer earth


[11/12/2022 9:36 PM] 5298_
I'm going to kill the man who made this game


[11/12/2022 9:36 PM] 5298_
I'm going to commit violent acts of terror


[11/12/2022 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
why


[11/12/2022 9:37 PM] 5298_
Because it's not cross play


[11/12/2022 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh


[11/12/2022 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
All we need to do is cool venus to 31c


[11/12/2022 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then boom


[11/12/2022 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/12/2022 9:48 PM] 5298_
I want a new space game


[11/12/2022 9:48 PM] 5298_
But I can't find one


[11/12/2022 9:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Neither


[11/12/2022 9:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
outer wilds was too short for me


[11/12/2022 9:50 PM] 5298_
The only good ones cost too much money


[11/12/2022 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want something like no mans sky but not shit


[11/12/2022 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i also want to be able to walk around the ship


[11/12/2022 9:54 PM] 5298_
Why do they cost so much


[11/12/2022 9:54 PM] 5298_
And there are barely any good ones


[11/12/2022 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ik


[11/12/2022 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i want a game like kerbal space program mixed with space engine


[11/12/2022 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and maybe outer wilds or something


[11/12/2022 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/12/2022 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its the entire milky way galaxy tho


[11/12/2022 9:59 PM] 5298_
It's on offer for ¬£5 should I buy it?


[11/12/2022 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Look at some reviews and shit first


[11/12/2022 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its a hard game


[11/12/2022 10:00 PM] 5298_
7/10 stars on Steam


[11/12/2022 10:02 PM] 5298_
It also has thousands of negative reviews so fuck that


[11/12/2022 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dont blame them


[11/12/2022 10:04 PM] 5298_
I really like Outer Wilds I just hate the time constraints


[11/12/2022 10:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same, its part of the lore though and when you find out the reason behind them the game becomes 1000x more interesting


[11/12/2022 10:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
for me at least it did


[11/12/2022 10:05 PM] 5298_
It's mainly with the Twins though, if you get there at the wrong time you literally can't do anything


[11/12/2022 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[11/12/2022 10:06 PM] 5298_
The 22 minute thing I can deal with but the twins just piss me off

It's a shake Peaky Blinders is set in Birmingham, it's a good show but I have to give 0/10 for being in Birmingham


[11/12/2022 11:06 PM] 5298_
Quite aptly Birmingham is still like this


[11/12/2022 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Same with Scouser


[11/12/2022 11:09 PM] 5298_
I want Brummy and Scouser to be slurs so I can offend Brummys and Scousers as much as possible


[11/12/2022 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/12/2022 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How far are you into outer wilds


[11/12/2022 11:10 PM] 5298_
I haven't been playing it much but I've pretty much searched the whole of the ash (?) Twin


[11/12/2022 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
atp


[11/12/2022 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ash twin p


[11/12/2022 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
professional


[11/12/2022 11:11 PM] 5298_
I think it's ash, the one that fills with ash and has the secret town


[11/12/2022 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats ember twin


[11/12/2022 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ash twin is the one with the buildings on it that are very interesting


[11/12/2022 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ember and ash twin are equally as interesting


[11/12/2022 11:12 PM] 5298_
I want to go through the whole solar system in order, so ember twin down the line


[11/12/2022 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
follow the ship log stuff, dont do it in order


[11/12/2022 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it leads you to every planet


[11/12/2022 11:13 PM] 5298_
Fair enough


[11/12/2022 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Do you think mars has plate tectonics


[11/12/2022 11:16 PM] 5298_
Yes, haven't we observed their movements? Or was that volcanic activity?


[11/12/2022 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The cracks are interesting


[11/12/2022 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that formed


[11/12/2022 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think its a sign of plate tectonics


[11/12/2022 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Poo stink fart? stinky.

[11/13/2022 1:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exoplanet


[11/13/2022 1:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
EUROPA > TITAN


[11/13/2022 1:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
FUCK TITAN


[11/13/2022 1:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I also think life doesnt have to abide by the earth-like rules set by us


[11/13/2022 1:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think theres only carbon-based life forms


[11/13/2022 1:27 AM] 5298_
There are 5,246 exoplanets Rylan, that's not easy


[11/13/2022 1:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We dont have to do all of them


[11/13/2022 1:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe evem just a fwer

[11/13/2022 1:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
EUROPA > TITAN


[11/13/2022 1:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
EUROPA > TITAN


[11/13/2022 1:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
EUROPA > TITAN


[11/13/2022 1:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

FUCK TITAN ALL MY HOMIES HATE TITAN


[11/13/2022 1:31 AM] 5298_
Well obviously there's most of the Trappist system, titan, Europa, Kepler-7B, Kepler-16B


[11/13/2022 1:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
titan europa do NOT NEED NAMES üò°

TRAPPIST-1F
TRAPPIST-1G

[11/13/2022 1:37 AM] 5298_
I really like Kepler-452b


[11/13/2022 1:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
KOI‚Äë4878.01


[11/13/2022 1:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Is 0.98, highest behind obviously Earth, on the Earth Similarity Index


[11/13/2022 1:38 AM] 5298_
Earth shouldn't be in the Earth Similarly Index


[11/13/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[11/13/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its literally just 1


[11/13/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but theres another issue


[11/13/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if a planet is more habitable than earth it lowers on the earth similarity index


[11/13/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we arent at that point yet


[11/13/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but yeah


[11/13/2022 1:40 AM] 5298_
Well then that planet would be 1.X


[11/13/2022 1:40 AM] 5298_
Earth is always going to be 1


[11/13/2022 1:40 AM] 5298_
Less habitable planets are 0.X and more habitable are 1.X


[11/13/2022 1:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good idea


[11/13/2022 1:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
However


[11/13/2022 1:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If it's more habitable, then it's less like Earth


[11/13/2022 1:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So having it higher than 1 would go against the whole thing


[11/13/2022 1:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Since it's less Earth-Like


[11/13/2022 1:44 AM] 5298_
They should just do a list of habitability with Earth being 1 and every planet in a list down so KOI-4878.01 is 0.9


[11/13/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes

The calculation of the ESI is based on only a few parameters: radius, density, escape velocity, and surface temperature. For exoplanets, the ESI is based on even fewer parameters: stellar flux, and either radius or mass.


[11/13/2022 1:45 AM] 5298_
(I was trying to find the exact number of planets in the Milky Way to list KELT-9B but I couldn't find the number it was just 100-200 billion planets and a 100 billion difference is a bit much


[11/13/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/13/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If amino acids arranged themselves into life here, then they can definitely do it elsewhere in the universe

[11/13/2022 2:05 AM] 5298_
My hair was wrapped around it and I couldn't undo it


[11/13/2022 2:07 AM] 5298_
I think I just came up with a new phrase when pulling my hair out


[11/13/2022 2:08 AM] 5298_
Oh good Jesus Christ fucking Joseph, how the fuck did I come up with that one


[11/13/2022 2:11 AM] 5298_
I've thought of cutting it off before, getting my hair short again


[11/13/2022 2:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/13/2022 2:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

A Greek Goddess was feeding her baby son but a God stole him from her half way through and her magic Goddess breast milk stained the sky and made the Milky Way and that's why we call it that

Westmeath Examiner, November, 1921"Grounded Their Arms."Barrack Scene Described by Ex-Connaught Ranger.Private Daly's Death.The "Freeman's Journal" publishes the following; What took place in an Indian barracks last year, when the Connaught Rangers, one of whom was subsequently shot, protested against the treatment that was then being meted out to their countrymen at home is briefly described in a letter that has arrived in Tullamore from an ex-member of the corps, who, for the part he played, is now serving a term of imprisonment in Liverpool. It is significant that Mr James Clarke, Tullamore, to whom the letter is addressed, is now in Ballykinlar Internment Camp.The writer, Joseph Walsh, a native of Tullamore, says;--"I am writing to see if you will be kind enough to give me any news of my family, especially my poor old parents. The only thing I am frightened about is my mother's position. Thank God I can hold up my head and say that I was not sent to prison for anything disgraceful. I expect you have seen all about the case in the newspapers, but I can assure you that you or anybody also did not see the truth of this affair in print; nor will it ever be known until some of us get released. "You know it would be impossible to tell you all in this letter, Simply 410 men grounded their arms, protesting against the attitude of the Government in Ireland; 105 were tried by general courtmartial; 64 were convicted, the sentences ranging from death to 12 month's imprisonment; 14 were condemned to death; 13 were reprieved. One was shot on November, 2nd, 1920. The remainder came home and are in Maidstone Convict Prison, Walton Prison, Manchester and Working prisons.

"Jack Lloyd, myself, and two other Birr men represented King's County, the other chaps came from Sligo, Boyle, Roscommon, Roscrea, Westmeath. The chap that was shot (Daly) came from Tyrrellspass-he was a brave man, He was exactly 21 years and 11 months old when he died; I cooked all his food up to the day he died. Jack Lloyd, was acquitted." I got five years penal servitude, which was reduced to 3 years, and I have 12 months to complete from November 13th, and I do not expect any day knocked off until the Irish question is finished. Remember me to all the boys. I am allowed to write only once in four months."

All other countries are run by little girls
Kazakhstan, number one exporter of potassium
All other countries have inferior potassium

Kazakhstan, home of Tinshein swimming pool
It's length thirty meter, width six meter
Filtration system a marvel to behold
It remove 80% of human solid waste

Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, you very nice place
From plains of Tarashek to northern fence of Jewtown
Kazakhstan friend of all except Uzbekistan
They very nosey people, with bone in their brain

Kazakhstan, industry best in world
We invented toffee and trouser belt
Kazakhstan's prostitutes, cleanest in the region
Except of course for Turkmenistan's

Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, you very nice place
From plains of Tarashek to northern fence of Jewtown
Come grasp mighty penis of our leader
From junction with the testes to tip of its face!

[11/13/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Hello there!

Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.
Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.
Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.

Below, is the sequence of past events:
In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).
Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in your Account Email with your password


[11/13/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A week after that, I downloaded the entire copy of your Account Email, including Photos, Videos, Contacts, History of visited websites atd atd.
After that i have installed a  malware in your Iphone and allows me to access to all controllers in your Iphone, such as video camera, microphone atd atd 
I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.
My malware unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is os-based), and hereby stays invisible for Google and so many antivirus
So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment... While collecting your information, I have found several very interesting photos and videos üòâ

If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.
It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.
I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are your phot and video, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.

Let's resolve it like this:
All you need is $1.900 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.
Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful malware will be deleted from all devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.
If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online or you can buy from:


[11/13/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
1)   OR 2)   

Here is my bitcoin wallet:   

You are given not more than 24 hours after you have opened this email (1 days to be precise).

Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:
> Do not attempt format your Iphone, it is meaningless too, because all your photo and videos are already available at remote servers.

Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:
> That I will not receive the money you transferred.
> Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor your Iphone (My malware includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).
Everything will be carried out based on fairness!

Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!
An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.


[11/13/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what he sent


[11/13/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
hes a fucking idiot


[11/13/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If its who im thinking of hes ukrainian


[11/13/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
plus you need my phone to get into my account so

[11/13/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont even have an iphone


[11/13/2022 10:43 PM] 5298_

[11/13/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i made an apple id account for no reason


[11/13/2022 10:46 PM] 5298_
I don't know about you but if I had nudes on my phone I wouldn't pay $1.900 to not have them sent, to be fair it is a crime for them to be sent and this man would immediately go to prison for possession and distribution of child pornography


[11/13/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont have porn on my phone or google account either


[11/13/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so its clearly a template they send


[11/13/2022 10:47 PM] 5298_
I don't understand why people send or keep nudes or safe pornography on their phones


[11/13/2022 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/13/2022 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its the stupidest shit ever


[11/13/2022 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im never gonna send nudes because its easy for them to get around


[11/13/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
There are many websites for that that you can very easily hide your activity of


[11/13/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
You don't need the risk of having them saved to your phone or sending things to people


[11/13/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

They're Irish Catholic so the marriage  should be near the birthdate of their children


[11/13/2022 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill look through the parish marriages and stuff too


[11/13/2022 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nothing comes out in the parish marriages


[11/13/2022 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
findmypast.co.uk is what im using

[11/13/2022 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the fires


[11/13/2022 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and wars


[11/13/2022 11:06 PM] 5298_
Because if we found a Dominic Mulvey born near Dublin whose last census was in the early-mid 70's we'd know it's my grandad and we can then look at the censuses he appeared in and find my family


[11/13/2022 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats what im saying


[11/13/2022 11:07 PM] 5298_
Then when we find his mother and father we look at their census years and keep going until we have a comprehensive family tree


[11/13/2022 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think this is plausible

In the models that they show at like talks and stuff the planet always orbits above the star when theyre at the same level

It's a sphere, no matter where it is it's the same level


[11/16/2022 6:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont know how to describe it


[11/16/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
relative to the equator, the orbit is always too high


[11/16/2022 6:46 PM] 5298_
Oh right, the centre of the orbit is level with the equator


[11/16/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes

a part of the orbit always needs to pass the equator of the gravitator, and relative to the viewer, the exact center of it

I defy anyone to explain these occasional ùëáùë§ùëúùë°ùë°ùëúùë† (Twitter Lottos) where some homeless peasant with 106 followers hits the jackpot and gets over ùü¥,ùü¨ùü¨ùü¨ ùóπùó∂ùó∏ùó≤ùòÄ -- & the likes are still rising by 1 like every 5 seconds, 6 hours after he tweeted.

One of the comments on that video makes so much sense


[11/17/2022 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the she sells sea shells on the sea shore tongue twister is a metaphor for the whole diamond industry


[11/17/2022 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyre really common, but they control the supply of them to make them seem rare


[11/17/2022 6:36 PM] 5298_
She sells sea shells on the sea shore
But the value of these shells will fall
Due to the laws of supply and demand
No one wants to buy shells cause there's loads on the sand


[11/17/2022 6:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Step 1


[11/17/2022 6:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you must create a sense of scarcity


[11/17/2022 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
shells will sell much better if the people think theyre rare you see


[11/17/2022 6:37 PM] 5298_
Step 1: you must create a sense of scarcity, shells will sell much better if the people think they're rare you see, bare with me

Rwyras should be ascend


[11/17/2022 9:31 PM] 5298_
Because Rwyaly is leader and Aly is to lead so it makes sense Rwyras would be ascend because ras is to ascend


[11/17/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I misspelt it


[11/17/2022 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
leader is supposed to be Fywraly


[11/17/2022 9:33 PM] 5298_
I really like Fywraog and Fywr


[11/17/2022 9:34 PM] 5298_
Same with Fywraly too


[11/17/2022 9:35 PM] 5298_
What's the difference between fywras and fywr?


[11/17/2022 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its just shortened to be a prefix

Everyone on the planet from the age of five has to start preparing to earn a lie to get necessities and if they don't they'll fucking die of starvation, we have farms that stretch to the horizon and still people are starving because of a lie they weren't good enough to be sold


[11/17/2022 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why should we pay to live on a planet we were born on


[11/17/2022 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we have no control over our birth


[11/17/2022 10:17 PM] 5298_
1929, if something happens to affect a lie we will kill ourselves over the lie


[11/17/2022 10:17 PM] 5298_
Exactly


[11/17/2022 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
to be honest though, if everyone had any resource they wanted without control the world would be a much worse place


[11/17/2022 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think money, it causes issues but it solves the major issues


[11/17/2022 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
People without money should at least be given a home food and water though


[11/17/2022 10:19 PM] 5298_
No it doesn't, community will solve those problems. Globalization will ruin the human race


[11/17/2022 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My life is going to be a shit one anyway


[11/17/2022 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I doubt ill have medication in time for gcses


[11/17/2022 10:22 PM] 5298_
If we didn't have globalization we could live in smaller communities which would discourage theft and then everyone would have a job and do trade. There would be bakers that trade their bread with the farmers for more wheat and flower, butchers that trade their meat for better knives, community wells for water ect.


[11/17/2022 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[11/17/2022 10:24 PM] 5298_
Capitalism isn't needed, the only time capitalism is needed is during globalization


[11/17/2022 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Capitalism would still be needed on a smaller scale


[11/17/2022 10:24 PM] 5298_
Globalization can be good but it's caused so much more harm then good


[11/17/2022 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If a drought happens and production stalls in that community, prices will have to be raised or theyll starve


[11/17/2022 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
for example


[11/17/2022 10:26 PM] 5298_
Kindness, generosity. If certain people can't make enough to trade, isn't the good thing to do to give free food to them? If you live in a smaller community you will get to know people and if you know them you'll want to be kind to them


[11/17/2022 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When your life is on the line, all of that goes to waste


[11/17/2022 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A drought would affect the whole community, therefore kindness and generosity would only get them so far before they turn on each other and morals go out the window


[11/17/2022 10:27 PM] 5298_
If an entire community is affected, then there's not much they can do


[11/17/2022 10:28 PM] 5298_
But because there's no capitalism and no globalization what's stopping them from taking the animals and some left over food and leaving, going to a place without drought and making by there until it's safe to back home


[11/17/2022 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What if the animal is affected too though? If they leave early in the drought that would work


[11/17/2022 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Droughts can be small, but can also be fucking huge


[11/17/2022 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And cover continents at once


[11/17/2022 10:30 PM] 5298_
But to be fair it's an extreme example, I'm thinking in this idealistic world the industrial revolution didn't happen, or at least not as powerful as we have it so there wouldn't be much if any global warming so these disasters would be few and far between


[11/17/2022 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[11/17/2022 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theres always a chance to reverse global warming


[11/17/2022 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theres got to be a way to unbond or whatever the word is carbon from oxygen


[11/17/2022 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that can be used on a large scale


[11/17/2022 10:31 PM] 5298_
It's not going to happen, I don't think it will


[11/17/2022 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that isnt a plant because it would be killed


[11/17/2022 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
climate change is slowing down now


[11/17/2022 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so id say its possible that it atleast stops


[11/17/2022 10:33 PM] 5298_
China, India, Saudi Arabia, Australia. All of them are huge carbon producing countries that aren't doing hardly enough


[11/17/2022 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[11/17/2022 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just invade china they need freedom dont they? üá∫üá∏


[11/17/2022 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would produce a lot of greenhouse gases


[11/17/2022 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but thats only for a short time

They should redo the one child policy but make it the no child policy so the whole country dies out

I wonder if capitalism exists on other alien worlds


[11/17/2022 10:34 PM] 5298_
I hope not


[11/17/2022 10:35 PM] 5298_
Let's hope there's not a Galactic Nazi civilization where it's one huge version of their master race and they fucking kill us all in alien concentration camps


[11/17/2022 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lets be real


[11/17/2022 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there probably is an alien nazi


[11/17/2022 10:36 PM] 5298_
That's not happening


[11/17/2022 10:36 PM] 5298_
There 100% is an alien nazi

then what would stop it around the universe


[11/17/2022 10:36 PM] 5298_
But an alien Nazi that won? That's absurd


[11/17/2022 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im pretty sure they think life is a lot more common than they originally thought


[11/17/2022 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wouldnt say so


[11/17/2022 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if the axis was just germany and italy, i think they couldve won


[11/17/2022 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also if the germans successfully invaded the uk first before the soviets


[11/17/2022 10:38 PM] 5298_
If Germany didn't try and fuck over Russia they would have won


[11/17/2022 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/17/2022 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They came close to winning in ww1


[11/17/2022 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
very close

[11/17/2022 10:43 PM] 5298_
There is no way Japan would have given up without Hiroshima and Nagasaki


[11/17/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I WISH VENUS AND MARS WERE HABITABLE


[11/17/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I WISH WE COULD SEE THE LIFE ON THEM


[11/17/2022 10:44 PM] 5298_
If we took most of the carbon from Venus' atmosphere and put it into Mars' they would both probably be habitable


[11/17/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/17/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or


[11/17/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we turned removed the carbon from the oxygen on venus


[11/17/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then took all of the water out of its atmosphere


[11/17/2022 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would be habitable


[11/17/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then we take most of the carbon from venus


[11/17/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and put it on mars


[11/17/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then boom


[11/17/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was born in the wrong time


[11/17/2022 10:45 PM] 5298_
What time would you like to have been born in?


[11/17/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the far future or the 1700s-1800s so i could explore


[11/17/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i like to explore


[11/17/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it wouldve been pretty shit in the 1700s-1800s


[11/17/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because of the lack of technology


[11/17/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but exploring the world would be cool


[11/17/2022 10:46 PM] 5298_
The past is wonderful because of pre-industry and pre-globalization but pretty much everything else was shit


[11/17/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
Lack of rights for pretty much everything that wasn't the king
Extreme taxes
Not enough food
Lack of healthcare and healthcare workers
Insane spirituality


[11/17/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
But enough about 2022


[11/17/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
If only the industrial revolution was stream powered


[11/17/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
I've said that wrong


[11/17/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
I'm too tired


[11/17/2022 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lol

[11/18/2022 8:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I had a dream last night of burning Union Jacks

[11/18/2022 8:44 PM] 5298_
Then suddenly I was at the top of the Slag Bank giving a speak to a bunch of people standing below about revolution and the dissolution of the union

I have a credit card now and I want to make money online

dylan i need to work on cumbric


[11/18/2022 8:50 PM] 5298_
You could make some form of art and sell it


[11/18/2022 8:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nft


[11/18/2022 8:51 PM] 5298_
I know, you could do more of those educational videos


[11/18/2022 8:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i have an idea that is so fucking easy


[11/18/2022 8:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
get people to pay me like five quid to make a video with music lyrics


[11/18/2022 8:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao


[11/18/2022 8:52 PM] 5298_
Like the weather one you did that got loads of views, do things like that on a channel, get it monetised and you could get quite a bit of money


[11/18/2022 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what was the weather one


[11/18/2022 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont have educational weather videos


[11/18/2022 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i have hurricane season animations


[11/18/2022 8:52 PM] 5298_
That's what I meant


[11/18/2022 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they get like 100-1k views but take days to make and in that time i lose interest


[11/18/2022 8:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
since hurricanes and tropical cyclones affect a lot of people, and people find videos that visualise data they tend to get a lot of views lmao


[11/18/2022 8:55 PM] 5298_
Rylan I have a proposal for you. We could do educational videos - like Tom Scott and Wendigoon - and we can work on them together, do the research and scripts and visuals together, put it on a channel and split any money 50/50


[11/18/2022 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good idea honestly


[11/18/2022 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just dont like reading with my voice


[11/18/2022 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i could do visuals and stuff


[11/18/2022 8:55 PM] 5298_
I can do the reading, I have a good microphone


[11/18/2022 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have a good microphone too


[11/18/2022 8:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
good is subjective tho


[11/18/2022 8:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
whats good for you might not be good for me


[11/18/2022 8:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
is that how you use subjective


[11/18/2022 8:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im assuming its definition


[11/18/2022 8:57 PM] 5298_
This is my microphone

[11/18/2022 8:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/18/2022 8:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/18/2022 8:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/18/2022 8:58 PM] 5298_
Pop filters are very useful


[11/18/2022 8:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was going to get a microphone arm that attaches to my desk and one of those at some point when i used to live stream


[11/18/2022 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dylan you can be reader guy


[11/18/2022 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we can research and do scripts together i guess and ill do the editing and visuals


[11/18/2022 8:59 PM] 5298_
Rylan, I think we should do obscure but interesting topics. I like to watch those more than things that everyone knows


[11/18/2022 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes


[11/18/2022 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I also like shit like that


[11/18/2022 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
itll take a lot of endurance though since it can take up to a year for your channel to attract a decent audience


[11/18/2022 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But


[11/18/2022 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/18/2022 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/18/2022 9:01 PM] 5298_
I'll make the channel and I'll share the info with you so you can join it too. We need a memorable name


[11/18/2022 9:01 PM] 5298_
Something simple


[11/18/2022 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill do some thinking


[11/18/2022 9:03 PM] 5298_
Is there a specific type of thing we want to focus on?


[11/18/2022 9:03 PM] 5298_
Physics? We could do the history of physics and the lives of physicists


[11/18/2022 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Anything thats interesting i think


[11/18/2022 9:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im making a name now


[11/18/2022 9:04 PM] 5298_
What is it? I'll make the channel

[11/18/2022 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it means land


[11/18/2022 9:07 PM] 5298_
Maybe because this is a place for all learning


[11/18/2022 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good idea


[11/18/2022 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/18/2022 9:31 PM] 5298_

Continental Drift Theory: How Alfred Wegener shaped the study of Geology


[11/18/2022 9:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There's a title


[11/18/2022 9:51 PM] 5298_
"Stealing From the Land of Giants" since the 1800's Argentina and Brazil have made colonial paleontology illegal, we could look into that


[11/18/2022 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Another idea


[11/18/2022 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we should make a list of ideas


[11/18/2022 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and choose one


[11/18/2022 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Have you heard of thoughty 2?


[11/18/2022 9:53 PM] 5298_
Yes


[11/18/2022 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i like watching his videos, maybe we can steal his way of making titles


[11/18/2022 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or take that idea on board when making titles


[11/18/2022 9:54 PM] 5298_
Yeah, I like Tom Scott's titles


[11/18/2022 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
another idea for titles


[11/18/2022 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
let's think of one now


[11/18/2022 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you pick an idea


[11/18/2022 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and we'll make a title


[11/18/2022 9:55 PM] 5298_
What's your Email? I'll add you to my Google doc for ideas

I'll make a twitter account for the channel despite the death of twitter currently happening


[11/18/2022 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'll put in a random birth date cause why not


[11/18/2022 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wait


[11/18/2022 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what birth day should we put in


[11/18/2022 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we're both 13 so any of ours would work, just the content is limited


[11/18/2022 9:58 PM] 5298_
I put 2/09/2000


[11/18/2022 9:58 PM] 5298_
For my email so go with that


[11/18/2022 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

The twitter account is linked to the gmail


[11/18/2022 10:01 PM] 5298_
I think a good way to get obscure things is to pick a time, topic and location and put those into google and look until we find something interesting, research it and make it a script


[11/18/2022 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good idea


[11/18/2022 10:04 PM] 5298_
I think having the videos go:
Quick Blurb of the story
A quick history of what we're talking about 
The story
( If there is one ) how this shaped the world today


[11/18/2022 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nice format


[11/18/2022 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Should keep viewer retention since the main story is towards the end


[11/18/2022 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just do this


[11/18/2022 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/18/2022 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/18/2022 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Best idea is to put links in the description


[11/18/2022 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
can i get another quote for the twitter banner?


[11/18/2022 10:08 PM] 5298_ (pinned)
I think a sentence or two about the topic in the beginning is good, for example Jack the Ripper
"1888, Crime is strife within London and many young women are having to resort to prostitution to put food on the table. In these narrow streets of crime and debauchery an ambiguous man would quickly become one of the most famous people in history yet we still don't know who he is. This is the story of Jack the Ripper"


[11/18/2022 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/18/2022 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That sounds fucking awesome


[11/18/2022 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
infact


[11/18/2022 10:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/18/2022 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
will we have a video schedule


[11/18/2022 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
every 2 weeks?


[11/18/2022 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its a 2 man job and the visuals could take a bit


[11/18/2022 10:16 PM] 5298_
Every two weeks seems good


[11/18/2022 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wont mention it until its set in stone


[11/18/2022 10:17 PM] 5298_
It'll take a while to construct a video and then we need to make it, then make it look really good and then it's ready to go


[11/18/2022 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/18/2022 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill quickly verify our channel so we can make interesting videos lmfao

To get monetized we need to prove we're over 18 lmfao might be a bit hard


[11/18/2022 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/18/2022 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
might also be easy


[11/18/2022 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or


[11/18/2022 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we make videos for 2 months and follow all guidelines


[11/18/2022 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lets go with that option


[11/18/2022 10:21 PM] 5298_
We should get quite a few ideas on our document


[11/18/2022 10:21 PM] 5298_
That's far easier


[11/18/2022 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[11/18/2022 10:21 PM] 5298_
That's 4 videos

This is what I have so far


[11/19/2022 8:42 PM] 5298_
From 1564 to 1642 one of the world's greatest minds, and Italy's pride and joy, walked the streets. This man‚Äôs life was full of extraordinary achievement but something less known was his controversy. From dutchesses to the Roman Inquisition itself, everyone had something to say about the theory of Galileo Galilei. 

Galilei was a physicist, engineer and mathematician. Arguably his most famous invention - which is rarely attributed to him - is the telescope. Galileo would publish his observations in his telescope in 1610 in the ‚ÄúSidereus Nuncius‚Äù. This is where Galileo‚Äôs problems would come from. 

In the seventeenth century most people believed in Aristotelian Geocentrism. Mainly this was for religious regions, people believed that the Earth was naturally the most important planet because all of God's creatures lived on it. This set the stage for Galileo‚Äôs controversy, unlike others of the day, he believed in heliocentrism. These beliefs garnered Galileo attention from people who held opposing views. He gained scientific and religious opposition alike. 

The religious opposition first came from The Grand Duchess Christina of Florence who wrote to one of the astronomers friends saying that heliocentrism is contrary to the Bible. This letter made Galileo write to the Grand Duchess saying that heliocentrism actually isn‚Äôt contrary to the Bible and even if it wasn‚Äôt that the Bible is a source of spiritual and moral wisdom and not science.


[11/19/2022 8:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You should add some more to the first paragraphs and keep viewers waiting for information, since that keeps viewer retention and intereset up


[11/19/2022 8:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
interest*


[11/19/2022 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dont stretch out for too long though


[11/19/2022 8:49 PM] 5298_
It took nearly three paragraphs to say the word heliocentrism which is what the videos about but I'll try and add more


[11/19/2022 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Alright


[11/19/2022 8:49 PM] 5298_
One moment, I'm going to time myself reading it and stop when I say heliocentrism

viewer retention is a major factor in the youtube algorithm


[11/19/2022 8:57 PM] 5298_
I still have the rest of the story to do and a conclusion where I want to talk about telescopes and how Galileo helped us find things he could never have imagined


[11/19/2022 8:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[11/19/2022 8:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think you should just do a bit about his backstory


[11/19/2022 8:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think his backstory would be interesting as a prologue to the video


[11/19/2022 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The youtube algorithm looks at a couple of factors - the description and tags, viewer retention and likes


[11/19/2022 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and click-through rate


[11/19/2022 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If you want to the algorithm to be in your favour, you need to keep people interested


[11/19/2022 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you also need to pull them in


[11/19/2022 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If you have a low viewer retention rate then its less likely to recommend you because they make less money off you


[11/19/2022 9:01 PM] 5298_
They aren't making any money off us yet


[11/19/2022 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They have their ways


[11/19/2022 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If I remember correctly, they recommend other videos similar to yours, so they make money off you since you're a gateway to binge-watching


[11/19/2022 9:02 PM] 5298_
I think we should favour the audience over the algorithm, still hold the algorithm in high regard but if you make really good videos people will want to come back for more


[11/19/2022 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/19/2022 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Audience and algorithm I say


[11/19/2022 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
a fine balance wont do harm


[11/19/2022 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
hold them both in high regard


[11/19/2022 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/19/2022 9:17 PM] 5298_
Panmathisa is awesome


[11/19/2022 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/19/2022 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like the name I made


[11/19/2022 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should watch a load of videos and figure out how to make a script that keeps viewers interested


[11/19/2022 9:20 PM] 5298_
I'll watch some Exurb1a, you watch some Thoughty2 and we'll come back and share what we found


[11/19/2022 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I love watching thoughty2 anyways


[11/19/2022 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I understand his method a bit


[11/19/2022 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he likes to ramble a lot though, which is always interesting


[11/19/2022 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he keeps the story back for quite a bit and talks about the backstory


[11/19/2022 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I made a tiny sample which looks very similar to the graphics he makes


[11/19/2022 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in after effects


[11/19/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The thing is


[11/19/2022 9:22 PM] 5298_
I love watching Exurb1a, I would watch some Wendigoon but we're not doing 3 hour videos so there's no point


[11/19/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thoughty2 always seems to misrepresent fact


[11/19/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so we shouldnt stray that far


[11/19/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But I like his format


[11/19/2022 9:25 PM] 5298_
Exactly, I don't watch him any more because he went too far to the algorithm and too far away from entertainment


[11/19/2022 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/19/2022 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He didnt stray too far from the algorithm, he's always been the same


[11/19/2022 9:27 PM] 5298_
I meant he went too far to pleasing the algorithm


[11/19/2022 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh lol


[11/19/2022 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Panmathsia


[11/19/2022 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that is an awesome name


[11/19/2022 10:00 PM] 5298_
Exurb1a: 
Starts with a comedic summary of what the video will about
Then goes into the introduction  preparing the viewer for the main subject 
Goes into the main topic
Typically philosophical ranting near the end 
The main message of the video as the outro


[11/19/2022 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nice format


[11/19/2022 10:03 PM] 5298_
I think if we apply that somewhat to the Galileo video we would have:
Introduction about what the video is about
History of Galileo
Galileo's controversy and the important history of The Holy Roman Empire's history with science 
Talking about telescopes and how it relates back to Galileo and what we've found with them


[11/19/2022 10:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/19/2022 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2.29 words per second


[11/19/2022 10:11 PM] 5298_
You know we were talking about bringing mars back to life


[11/19/2022 10:11 PM] 5298_
What about the magnetic field?


[11/19/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/19/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was thinking about that


[11/19/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
a lot


[11/19/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i never mentioned it


[11/19/2022 10:13 PM] 5298_
A Taurus shield might work


[11/19/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe


[11/19/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But


[11/19/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
an atmosphere will certainly put some amount of pressure on the core


[11/19/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so if the atmosphere becomes 100x heavier then what would that do to the core


[11/19/2022 10:15 PM] 5298_
The core used to be able to support an atmosphere, I'm not sure what it shutting down would do it to it really but it might work


[11/19/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fart


[11/19/2022 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So shall we begin work on video tomorrow


[11/19/2022 10:30 PM] 5298_
Yes, I'll finish the script and send it to you


[11/19/2022 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i am making a little test

italy is going to turn into 1564 italy


[11/19/2022 11:29 PM] 5298_
Why specifically 1564?


[11/19/2022 11:29 PM] 5298_
Because of Galileo?


[11/19/2022 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes

It's quite fast-paced, but that should keep viewers attention as it is constantly stimulating the brain


[11/20/2022 11:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Was that animation thingy alright


[11/20/2022 11:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i might slow it down a bit


[11/20/2022 11:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and move 1564 to the start


[11/20/2022 11:11 AM] 5298_
It was great

[11/20/2022 4:00 PM] 5298_
It has ambiguity whilst still showing the theme of the video, it has everything important without overbearing the viewer and it's got the Panmathisa logo


[11/20/2022 4:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/20/2022 4:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am now waiting for ze scripten to be finished and read so i can work on video


[11/20/2022 4:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wonder if people will still watch upon hearing a 14 year old boy


[11/20/2022 4:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That could be another experiment of ours


[11/20/2022 4:12 PM] 5298_
I've been thinking about that. A.I. could work, get a realistic A.I. to read it for us


[11/20/2022 4:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We could try that too


[11/20/2022 4:12 PM] 5298_
But then any inflections we want won't be added


[11/20/2022 4:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[11/20/2022 4:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should go with voice i think


[11/20/2022 4:14 PM] 5298_
I'll try different A.I's first


[11/20/2022 4:28 PM] 5298_

[11/20/2022 4:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/20/2022 4:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think we should do voice


[11/20/2022 4:32 PM] 5298_
You know carpet bombing


[11/20/2022 4:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes


[11/20/2022 4:33 PM] 5298_
What if we did that to all of England but nuclear


[11/20/2022 4:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nuclear carpet bombing


[11/20/2022 4:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that would need quite the plane


[11/20/2022 4:36 PM] 5298_
We take a page out of Japan's book and we have hundreds of planes all carrying one nuclear bomb, they fly in a big squadron and drop all their bombs and they try and fly away but if not oh well


[11/20/2022 4:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
good idea


[11/20/2022 4:38 PM] 5298_

Why are people so scared of socialism? We have at least one socialist practice in this country that I know of and we all fucking love it. It's literally the best part of the country


[11/20/2022 4:42 PM] 5298_
The NHS is socialist


[11/20/2022 4:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im not sure why people are scared of socialism


[11/20/2022 4:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
labour over tories


[11/20/2022 4:43 PM] 5298_
Americans are more scared of socialism than they are of nuclear war

I think the Galileo should be a practice video so we can get better video making


[11/20/2022 5:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/20/2022 5:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we should still upload it, but it can kind of test the waters and also it can help us improve our video production


[11/20/2022 5:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am honestly very excited to work on the video


[11/20/2022 5:28 PM] 5298_
I can't wait to see it. From what you've shown me it seems like it'll look great


[11/20/2022 5:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/20/2022 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should still be able to say that line


[11/20/2022 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
youtube follows us copyright laws


[11/20/2022 6:28 PM] 5298_
I was thinking we actually use the music to fade the video out


[11/20/2022 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh


[11/20/2022 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just say that line and we should be good


[11/20/2022 6:29 PM] 5298_
And it's not transformative so we can't get away with it


[11/20/2022 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmao


[11/20/2022 6:29 PM] 5298_
They follow US laws but we still have to abide by English law too


[11/20/2022 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Trueful information


[11/20/2022 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
US laws are imposed on the platform


[11/20/2022 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
no matter which country you're in


[11/20/2022 6:30 PM] 5298_
We have to abide by US and UK law


[11/20/2022 6:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its fine, we can still close by saying that one line


[11/20/2022 6:32 PM] 5298_
Who wrote the Connaught Rangers song?


[11/20/2022 6:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wolfe Tones


[11/20/2022 6:32 PM] 5298_
Originally?


[11/20/2022 6:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I believe so


[11/20/2022 6:33 PM] 5298_
We could use It's a Long Way To Tipperary


[11/20/2022 6:33 PM] 5298_
I think


[11/20/2022 6:34 PM] 5298_
No we can't


[11/20/2022 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think we should leave ending music like that out of it


[11/20/2022 6:35 PM] 5298_
Nevermind we can


[11/20/2022 6:35 PM] 5298_
I think it would be a good and sombre way of leaving the video


[11/20/2022 6:36 PM] 5298_
By US copyright law we can use It's a Long Way to Tipperary because the original author died 77 years ago


[11/20/2022 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/20/2022 6:44 PM] 5298_
We can use anything written before 1952


[11/20/2022 6:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should focus on Gal.I.Leo


[11/20/2022 6:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I Leo


[11/20/2022 7:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Inform me of when the script is completed


[11/20/2022 7:07 PM] 5298_
I'll tell you when draft one is done, then you tell what I need to add and we'll keep going until we're both happy with it

[11/20/2022 7:35 PM] 5298_
Right now my good fellow


[11/20/2022 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wonderful news!


[11/20/2022 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Should I make a channel trailer quickly?


[11/20/2022 7:36 PM] 5298_
I think our favourite video should be the trailer thing


[11/20/2022 7:37 PM] 5298_
So every time we make a video we think is the best we change that to the trailer


[11/20/2022 7:56 PM] 5298_
I was trying to find out if Siderues Nuncius is Latin or Italian and I accidentally found something horrific


[11/20/2022 7:57 PM] 5298_
I misspelled Siderues and found this

[11/20/2022 7:59 PM] 5298_
It needs to be killed


[11/20/2022 8:00 PM] 5298_
I'm going to unleash more chemicals in that things home than was released in every concentration camp combined


[11/20/2022 8:08 PM] 5298_
I've added in a paragraph about other things Galileo discovered


[11/20/2022 8:10 PM] 5298_
How do you have access?


[11/20/2022 8:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
John


[11/20/2022 8:10 PM] 5298_
Wait, I didn't realise I'm writing this on the Panmathisa account


[11/20/2022 8:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmao


[11/20/2022 8:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should test the waters with this video and see if people actually want to watch Panmathsia


[11/20/2022 8:15 PM] 5298_
We need to make more than just one video and make it consistent if we want to push the Channel out there though


[11/20/2022 8:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/20/2022 8:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had a dream last night that I died but it feels real


[11/20/2022 8:18 PM] 5298_
I had a dream last night that I died too


[11/20/2022 8:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What the fuck


[11/20/2022 8:19 PM] 5298_
Rylan, I think we're the same person


[11/20/2022 8:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
All I can remember from it is that I felt funny so I lied in my bed then my head started going really light and felt like it was spinning on a vertical axis


[11/20/2022 8:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it didnt hurt but it felt uncomfortable


[11/20/2022 8:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then my eyelids went heavy and I just faded away


[11/20/2022 8:20 PM] 5298_
It was painful for me, I fell off a cliff and I felt everything inside of me break and my organs got pierced by shattered bones. It didn't last long before I woke up


[11/20/2022 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I knew I was dying though cause I shouted at someone that I was dying I think


[11/20/2022 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was so strange


[11/20/2022 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it felt so real I honestly cant tell if it was fake


[11/20/2022 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what if i did die last night


[11/20/2022 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
either way it felt very strange


[11/20/2022 8:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It felt like my head was spinning faster and faster and then my eyes closed


[11/20/2022 8:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but like vertically


[11/20/2022 8:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
on both sides of my head


[11/20/2022 8:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that is what it felt like

What do you think of the script so far?


[11/20/2022 8:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nice


[11/20/2022 8:25 PM] 5298_
You should check the last paragraph


[11/20/2022 8:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[11/20/2022 8:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might add a paragraph or 2 to the start about his childhood because I think it would be interesting to see how he was raised


[11/20/2022 8:28 PM] 5298_
Okay Rylan O'Neill.

[11/20/2022 8:29 PM] 5298_
Yes


[11/20/2022 8:35 PM] 5298_
I've had an idea


[11/20/2022 8:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
whats your idea


[11/20/2022 8:37 PM] 5298_
If we achieve faster than light travel we should send a telescope far out into space and then observe Earth with it and we can see what Earth was like hundreds of years ago, if we sent a telescope faster than light 300 million light years away from today we could see what Pangea was like


[11/20/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think about that sometimes


[11/20/2022 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If we compress space time to a point we can achieve ftl travel, what is stopping us from teleporting


[11/20/2022 8:46 PM] 5298_
If we can do it safely on a small enough scale we could have commercial teleportation


[11/20/2022 8:48 PM] 5298_
I think bending space time will be very damaging


[11/20/2022 8:49 PM] 5298_
When you fold a piece of paper you crease it, I think something similar will happen with space time. Every wormhole that's created space-time gets slightly damaged


[11/20/2022 8:49 PM] 5298_
Should I go to the conclusion? There isn't much more left to say


[11/20/2022 8:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
up to you


[11/20/2022 8:58 PM] 5298_
After you've added in the early life of Galileo we will have draft one


[11/20/2022 8:58 PM] 5298_
I think it's very good


[11/20/2022 8:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might not add that bit


[11/20/2022 8:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cba writing it cause it sounds retarded when i write lmfao


[11/20/2022 8:59 PM] 5298_
Give me any improvements you think I should make to the script


[11/20/2022 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not too sure


[11/20/2022 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Can you time how long it takes to read it


[11/20/2022 9:01 PM] 5298_
I keep messing it up


[11/20/2022 9:01 PM] 5298_
I can't fucking speak


[11/20/2022 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmao


[11/20/2022 9:05 PM] 5298_
4 minutes and 1 second ( time may vary )


[11/20/2022 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[11/20/2022 9:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
4 minutes and 1 second with editing might be a 4 minute 30 seconds video which is around what we were aiming for


[11/20/2022 9:07 PM] 5298_
When we go into more obscure topics we will get even longer videos


[11/20/2022 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/20/2022 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
plus we're new to this stuff so its bound to be short


[11/20/2022 9:08 PM] 5298_
True


[11/20/2022 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might start a new gaming channel from scratch in the mean time


[11/20/2022 9:12 PM] 5298_
I like creating things but I never know what to make. I really like Panmathisa though


[11/20/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i couldnt agree more


[11/20/2022 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like to make things but rarely do they see the light of day


[11/20/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
starting a gaming channel is only hard when you dont know what youre doing


[11/20/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
itll also take a bit for my channel to take off, but since I have more knowledge than beginners it should give me and advantage


[11/20/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
at some point i was getting 20 subs a day on my main gaming channel


[11/20/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which isnt a lot


[11/20/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it shows I was doing something right


[11/20/2022 9:14 PM] 5298_
Advertising


[11/20/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not going to advertise since it cost a bit too much


[11/20/2022 9:14 PM] 5298_
Do we want to advertise Panmathisa?


[11/20/2022 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think we should


[11/20/2022 9:16 PM] 5298_
Are there free advertising methods?


[11/20/2022 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure


[11/20/2022 9:17 PM] 5298_
I know you can buy ads on YouTube but I'm not sure how free advertising would work


[11/20/2022 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
MONEY GAME PART 1 AND 2 MAKES ME WANT TO COMMIT REBELLION


[11/20/2022 9:20 PM] 5298_

THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING! REBELLION IS THE WAY!


[11/20/2022 9:21 PM] 5298_
We could use the twitter to push out the videos


[11/20/2022 9:28 PM] 5298_
I've followed Panmathsia


[11/20/2022 9:41 PM] 5298_
You should tweet ambiguous things about every next video


[11/20/2022 9:41 PM] 5298_
So for this one you tweet Galileo related things like telescopes and heliocentric models and Galileo silhouettes all leading up to the video release


[11/20/2022 9:43 PM] 5298_
Thoughts?


[11/20/2022 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dont know


[11/20/2022 9:48 PM] 5298_
I can't wait to see your visuals


[11/20/2022 9:52 PM] 5298_
I'm getting an A.I. voice, I'll try it out


[11/20/2022 10:23 PM] 5298_

Its where you can animate google earth


[11/20/2022 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its very cool


[11/20/2022 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and helpful


[11/20/2022 10:39 PM] 5298_
We could use that for the Continental Drift video


[11/20/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
unfortunately


[11/20/2022 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you can not move continents around


[11/20/2022 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but you can probably use google maps


[11/20/2022 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so its all good


[11/20/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

The A.I. sound realistic but slightly robotic


[11/20/2022 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I noticed that


[11/20/2022 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
some sound realistic and not really robotic but something feels off


[11/20/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
It sounds realistic but you can tell it's not a real human very easily


[11/20/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Most of them are like that


[11/20/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like 90% just sound like a robot


[11/20/2022 10:49 PM] 5298_
What do we do then?

my voice is out there but i sound very retarded


[11/20/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill send you some clips of videos with thousands of views with my 2021 voice in them


[11/20/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my 2021 voice was supernaturally deep for no reason


[11/20/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like it sounds so forced but it wasnt


[11/20/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was really really deep


[11/20/2022 10:53 PM] 5298_
I remember


[11/20/2022 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i sounded like a fucking like gorilla or something


[11/20/2022 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thank fuck it faded away


[11/20/2022 10:53 PM] 5298_
Danielle was convinced you were faking it


[11/20/2022 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it mightve been hysteria or something


[11/20/2022 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i couldnt help it


[11/20/2022 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
whenever i spoke it went like that


[11/20/2022 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was always too embarrassed to speak cause of it

Teachers across the country are due to stage a 24-hour walkout after rejecting a 5% pay increase, calling for 10%.


[11/20/2022 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What does across the country refer to


[11/20/2022 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Scotland


[11/20/2022 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or the uk


[11/20/2022 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
probably scotland


[11/20/2022 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/20/2022 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I swear I died irl


[11/20/2022 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was so fucking weird


[11/20/2022 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i swear I shot up out of my sleep feeling weird and my head was spinning weirdly and i died

[11/20/2022 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what im thinking


[11/20/2022 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2 losses in 3 weeks in that timeline


[11/20/2022 11:48 PM] 5298_
What does that mean


[11/20/2022 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Doesnt matter lmao


[11/20/2022 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know that I was struggling to breathe last night as I was going to sleep and i know i was 100% awake at that point


[11/20/2022 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but then i passed out, woke up my head felt weird spinning then you know the rest


[11/20/2022 11:48 PM] 5298_
Let's figure out if this is a different time line, we should try and find a difference


[11/20/2022 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes


[11/20/2022 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Even then, if there is infinite timelines then there is an infinite number of timelines with the exact same events unfolding


[11/20/2022 11:49 PM] 5298_
Well no two timelines will be the same


[11/20/2022 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They will be, but there always the chance something couldve changed


[11/20/2022 11:50 PM] 5298_
Although, the only difference between this one and the other is that you are alive here and dead there


[11/20/2022 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[11/20/2022 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you know whats even stranger dylan


[11/20/2022 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you know how when you die in a dream, you wake up because your brain cant truly comprehend death


[11/20/2022 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i didnt wake up


[11/20/2022 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so that means 1 of 2 things


[11/20/2022 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can truly comprehend death


[11/20/2022 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or i died and moved timeline


[11/20/2022 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so now im scared about being immortal because I dont want to live forever lmfao


[11/20/2022 11:55 PM] 5298_
Or you believe you can comprehend death


[11/20/2022 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A third possibility


[11/20/2022 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i dont believe i can comprehend death


[11/20/2022 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe my subconscious does


[11/20/2022 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i dont


[11/20/2022 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im shitting my pants because i might be immortal and i would not like to be


[11/20/2022 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i also think it couldve been a brain thing


[11/20/2022 11:57 PM] 5298_
I think it's a brain thing


[11/20/2022 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
agreed


[11/20/2022 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but theres a possibility


[11/20/2022 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you know what else im scared of that i just got reminded of


[11/20/2022 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
getting stuck in a dream


[11/21/2022 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think my brain just stitched my thought that theres nothing together and put it there


[11/21/2022 12:11 AM] 5298_
I might not be in tomorrow


[11/21/2022 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I don't know why but when I got home I didn't feel real and when I was about to get a shower I felt like I was going to collapse from it so I sat on my bathroom floor and stared at the floor for half an hour


[11/22/2022 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think i might have ever so slight depression but i dont think its likely


[11/22/2022 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we both have an increased risk of it

[11/22/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can get hostile but ive become a much better manager of anger in the last 2 years or so


[11/22/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I used to get angry at absolutely everything


[11/22/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
literally anything


[11/22/2022 10:39 PM] 5298_
I have every single one of those


[11/22/2022 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am autism


[11/22/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate school because I feel like the teachers just fucking bully me


[11/22/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they tell me to control myself when I physically cannot


[11/22/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and act like i can just be normal at the click of a finger


[11/22/2022 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the only teachers with an ounce of understanding are the ones at the hub


[11/22/2022 10:42 PM] 5298_
I'm glad I don't have that because I would just fight every teacher who told me to control myself


[11/22/2022 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im so fucking sick of it 90% of the time im so close to just fucking walking off


[11/22/2022 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I always feel like I need to escape school


[11/22/2022 10:42 PM] 5298_
I very easily could


[11/22/2022 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its not a hard feat to pull off


[11/22/2022 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i just get punished for being a little bit different


[11/22/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyll never understand


[11/22/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
how i feel about it


[11/22/2022 10:43 PM] 5298_
The gate literally has foot holes in it


[11/22/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because i struggle to say how im feeling


[11/22/2022 10:44 PM] 5298_
What I do is tell the teachers what the problem is and my solution to the problem and if they don't listen to me I tell them that they aren't and tell them to basically fuck off they aren't helping


[11/22/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wish I could do that


[11/22/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My form tutors a knobhead


[11/22/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He specifically targets me


[11/22/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive come to that conclusion


[11/22/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he always tells me im a bright lad but then says fuck off control yourself you knob


[11/22/2022 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he went through my list of behaviour points and said that pretty much


[11/22/2022 10:45 PM] 5298_
I just stopped going to form without an explanation and they put me into the hub so I was actually somewhere


[11/22/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Where the fuck did you go in that time


[11/22/2022 10:46 PM] 5298_
I sat in Kells


[11/22/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[11/22/2022 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought so


[11/22/2022 10:46 PM] 5298_
Then teachers get telling me to go to form and I told them that forms hell and I'm not going back and after a while they put me in the hub


[11/22/2022 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might start doing that


[11/22/2022 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel like they never understand my issue, and the fact I feel like i cant speak when they talk to me amplifies it


[11/22/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
Then I kept getting kicked out for some reason so I went back to Kells then they stopped kicking me out and now I'm assigned a teacher in the hub to do form with me


[11/22/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Id enjoy school if it wasnt just a bunch of power hungry knobheads


[11/22/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and if they actually tried to help me learn


[11/22/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i learn more from my own research online than i do at schoo


[11/22/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
l


[11/22/2022 10:49 PM] 5298_
If you want during break or lunch tomorrow we can go to the hub and ask if you can come here instead. I'll explain the issue if you want me to


[11/22/2022 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe


[11/22/2022 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im nearly at the point of assessment now though


[11/22/2022 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i hope its by the end of this year because next year is crucial to me


[11/22/2022 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im trying to do well in year 9 but im struggling


[11/22/2022 10:51 PM] 5298_
I think I could help you with school because I understand you and I'm not a dickhead that'll tell you to shut up but the only problem is teachers won't let us work together


[11/22/2022 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like to learn by actually doing things


[11/22/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats the only thing i can do without getting too off track


[11/22/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can do all other types of learning but i struggle because I cant concentrate


[11/22/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The only people I speak to outside of school are my mates and my family


[11/22/2022 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate speaking to anyone else


[11/22/2022 10:53 PM] 5298_
I speak to my mum, dad, you and this one girl and that's it


[11/22/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fucking hell


[11/22/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im 90% sure if i wasnt always full of energy id have only a couple of mates and thats it


[11/22/2022 10:55 PM] 5298_
I'll always be your friend Rylan, you're an actually good and interesting human being which seems to be rare to find

You're welcome


[11/22/2022 10:59 PM] 5298_

[11/22/2022 11:01 PM] 5298_

Why would he do that?


[11/23/2022 4:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because he thinks that if I don't have any title I can keep a job


[11/23/2022 4:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because he's an asshole who thinks he knows everything


[11/23/2022 4:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Scottish independence: What would it mean for the NE and Cumbria?

On April 22nd, 1778, a lone USS Naval ship carried out a daring raid during the American Revolutionary War on the town of Whitehaven in England. It was a clear night and the frost had begun to settle across the west coast of Cumbria.

John Paul started his maritime career at age 13, sailing out of Whitehaven in the northern English county of Cumberland as apprentice aboard Friendship under Captain Benson. Paul's older brother William Paul had married and settled in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Virginia was the destination of many of the younger Paul's voyages.

Jones had some early successes against British merchant shipping in the Irish Sea. He persuaded his crew on April 17, 1778, to participate in an assault on Whitehaven, the town where his maritime career had begun.[22] Jones later wrote about the poor command qualities of his senior officers (having tactfully avoided such matters in his official report): "'Their object', they said, 'was gain not honor'. They were poor: instead of encouraging the morale of the crew, they excited them to disobedience; they persuaded them that they had the right to judge whether a measure that was proposed to them was good or bad".[23] As it happened, contrary winds forced them to abandon the attempt and drive Ranger towards Ireland, causing more trouble for British shipping on the way.

You can't tell anyone about this because I could get in legal trouble but you know the three rules you can't break in school?


[11/27/2022 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes


[11/27/2022 9:18 PM] 5298_
Well, I know a guy who could get me some drugs and a vape, if I plant it on Isabel, tell a teacher I think she has a vape and they find it and some weed on her she'll be permanently excluded


[11/27/2022 9:18 PM] 5298_
And I'm pretty sure her parents grow weed so police won't look too deep into where she got it


[11/27/2022 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/27/2022 9:20 PM] 5298_

[11/27/2022 9:26 PM] 5298_
I genuinely have a case against the school for allowing sexual harassment  against minors, so if I go to Savio and tell them to permanently suspend Isabel or I go the police, childline and Ofsted and tell them about my case and get the school shut down hopefully they would suspend her


[11/27/2022 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/27/2022 9:30 PM] 5298_
Moffat has sexually harassed me and threatened stalking and kidnapping against me and I've told the school and they refused to do anything, also there's the famous case of Mr. Edwards

[11/27/2022 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/27/2022 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/27/2022 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He's going out with a year 7 the freak


[11/27/2022 10:21 PM] 5298_
He was dating my step sister and tried to kiss me


[11/27/2022 10:22 PM] 5298_
He also kept making sexual comments about my step mother at dinner


[11/27/2022 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What a fucking perv


[11/27/2022 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Everybody stopped liking him in year 8


[11/27/2022 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Bet he was genuinely trying to kiss you too cause he's a closeted gay


[11/27/2022 10:23 PM] 5298_
He's tried loads


[11/27/2022 10:26 PM] 5298_
Mainly in my house


[11/27/2022 10:32 PM] 5298_
He kissed the masked before


[11/27/2022 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What a freak he is


[11/27/2022 10:43 PM] 5298_
I think he should be castrated by a rabid dog


[11/27/2022 10:46 PM] 5298_
Like a rabid rottweiler


[11/27/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/27/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Actually


[11/27/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/27/2022 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What


[11/28/2022 12:00 AM] 5298_
Seven constituencies voted for DUP and six for Sinn Fein so I'm going to see if that's always been the case and it might be that parliament has made the areas voting DUP more constituencies than Sinn Fein


[11/28/2022 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Niggardly


[11/28/2022 12:11 AM] 5298_
Is that where the stereotype of black people being criminals comes from? A dyslexic saw that in a dictionary and accidentally became racist


[11/28/2022 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I don't know


[11/28/2022 12:13 AM] 5298_
I often wonder where racist stereotypes came from


[11/28/2022 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

If you want to see the Jewish stereotypes just look at the bankers from Harry Potter ( Rowling is not a good woman )

[11/28/2022 12:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm slightly concerned


[11/28/2022 12:52 AM] 5298_
Why?


[11/28/2022 12:53 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The other day I smelt the scent that was unique to my relative that died, it wasn't deodorant or out and it was downstairs when everyone was asleep


[11/28/2022 12:53 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was by the kitchen door which is the room I normally saw them in before they died


[11/28/2022 12:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Anyway, I went downstairs then and heard a thud on my sofa and some tapping noise in the kitchen


[11/28/2022 12:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think it's nothing but my house seems to possess some sort of paranormal activity


[11/28/2022 12:55 AM] 5298_
That is slightly concerning


[11/28/2022 12:55 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I don't know how to describe the tap


[11/28/2022 12:55 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its a noise I've never heard in the kitchen before


[11/28/2022 12:56 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The sofa thud was definitely a thud on the sofa since the sofa makes that noise when something hits it


[11/28/2022 12:56 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And then the tapping in the kitchen sounded like a button on an old tv


[11/28/2022 12:56 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There is no old TV in the kitchen


[11/28/2022 12:56 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm not sure what it is


[11/28/2022 12:57 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I've seen the apparition of a woman in my house a couple of times tho


[11/28/2022 12:57 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was in between the corner of my eye and the center of my vision


[11/28/2022 12:57 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Most of the time


[11/28/2022 12:58 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When I was on my pc a while ago I saw a shadow right next to me kneeled down facing me then it vanished but I was playing horror games and I was on edge


[11/28/2022 12:58 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So my senses were heightened


[11/28/2022 12:58 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There's 1 thing that's happened that I have no fucking explanation for


[11/28/2022 12:59 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When I first moved in, my bathroom door was shut. For reference, my bedroom is right next to the bathroom. Then I heard a really loud scratching sound on it then I heard the handle pull down and the door opened


[11/28/2022 12:59 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I checked in there and there was nothing


[11/28/2022 1:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I moved in at the end of 2018


[11/28/2022 1:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe about half a year ago I found out a guy died in the bathroom


[11/28/2022 1:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But even before then I would feel uneasy in there


[11/28/2022 5:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Controversial opinion incoming: The n-word is a bad word


[11/28/2022 8:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so controversial


[11/28/2022 8:35 PM] 5298_
Not only in history and meaning but as a word in general, it sounds like it always needs to be a slur even if it meant like overjoyed I still wouldn't use it because it just doesn't sound good


[11/28/2022 8:35 PM] 5298_
Twitter.com won't like me for this one, they love the n-word


[11/28/2022 8:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ive seen the opposite of that


[11/28/2022 8:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its black people using it and white people getting mad at them for it


[11/28/2022 8:37 PM] 5298_
That's a bit stupid but I do agree that even if you are apart of the group a slur is used against you still shouldn't use it


[11/28/2022 8:37 PM] 5298_
I guess it boils down to equality versus equity


[11/28/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
some slurs shouldnt be slurs and some should be


[11/28/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the nword should be a slur


[11/28/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because of its origins


[11/28/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but retard shouldnt be because idiot, moron etc arent


[11/28/2022 8:39 PM] 5298_
I think most of them make sense, like the n-word, f-slur, d-slur, c-slur all the racial and anti-lgbt ones should be slurs because they dehumanize an oppressed minority


[11/28/2022 8:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Faggot is a stupid slur because faggot is a food


[11/28/2022 8:40 PM] 5298_
retard has a slightly different history but I agree that it shouldn't


[11/28/2022 8:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
99% of the time retard is used in the same way as them


[11/28/2022 8:40 PM] 5298_
It's a stupid slur but it should still be a slur


[11/28/2022 8:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Honestly


[11/28/2022 8:42 PM] 5298_
Yeah, the meaning of the word has changed so it shouldn't be offensive; like stupid, stupid has the exact same history as retard but stupid isn't a slur. I think it's because everyone is terrified of autism


[11/28/2022 8:43 PM] 5298_
people treat autistic like a slur but it's completely okay and not a single autistic person would care if you called them autistic


[11/28/2022 8:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[11/28/2022 8:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I also feel like society is becoming far too over accepting


[11/28/2022 8:46 PM] 5298_
In the hub the sign will say shit like "Did you know "X celerity" is dyslexic"  and right next to it "Did you know "X celerity" has autism". Why don't they say that the latter is autistic or that the former has dyslexia? That's not equality


[11/28/2022 8:46 PM] 5298_
I don't think we're quite there but we're getting dangerously close


[11/28/2022 8:47 PM] 5298_
case and point, furies. How can anyone accept that?


[11/28/2022 8:47 PM] 5298_
Pedophiles as well


[11/28/2022 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought that


[11/28/2022 8:49 PM] 5298_
I agree that most of the time a pedophile is that way because of trauma or mental illness but it's very easy to not rape a child. I think that thought, intent and action are all very different things and should be treated differently


[11/28/2022 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If you have thoughts like that you should see a therapist


[11/28/2022 8:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it must be fucking embarrassing but its better safe than sorry


[11/28/2022 8:52 PM] 5298_
Thoughts you should get professional help
Intent you should get someone assigned to you to make sure you don't commit the crimes 
Action should be a full life sentence, not like a twenty year called life I mean from the day you're imprisoned to the day you die


[11/28/2022 8:56 PM] 5298_
I think unprotected incest should be child abuse, protected incest is just weird but no one is being harmed there if both people are consenting adults


[11/28/2022 8:58 PM] 5298_
I think lgbt education needs to be taught to everyone, I think it might stop this over accepting attitude if done properly


[11/28/2022 9:00 PM] 5298_
I think most people think that it means you're allowed to fuck anything with more than two atoms but if taught properly it might show that furries and nonces are indeed wrong


[11/28/2022 10:56 PM] 5298_

There is a **non canonical** story of a miracle Baby Jesus did, a man couldn't get erect and was told of this miraculous man who can do the impossible so he looked at the _baby_ Jesus and got erect

panaesthetic is just being shallow


[11/28/2022 11:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the only thing that exists on that list is autistic


[11/28/2022 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and aromantic


[11/28/2022 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/28/2022 11:26 PM] 5298_
Aroace exists


[11/28/2022 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes ik


[11/28/2022 11:26 PM] 5298_
Yeah, the fucking spin wheel of letters isn't real


[11/28/2022 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Aroace shouldnt be celebrated as a pride thing


[11/28/2022 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
aromantic or asexual


[11/28/2022 11:27 PM] 5298_
I think it should


[11/28/2022 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[11/28/2022 11:27 PM] 5298_
Because a lot of people don't think it exists


[11/28/2022 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats fucking stupid that people dont think it exists


[11/28/2022 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because it does


[11/28/2022 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it shouldnt be a pride thing because of that


[11/28/2022 11:28 PM] 5298_
I mean like people who refuse to believe that people believe it


[11/28/2022 11:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Celebrating not liking anyone sounds fucking stupid


[11/28/2022 11:29 PM] 5298_
I'm on the fence between equality and equity


[11/28/2022 11:30 PM] 5298_
I'm swaying more towards equity


[11/28/2022 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If everyone wants equality then we shouldnt celebrate pride or straight people, we shouldnt celebrate different races


[11/28/2022 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
everyone should just be people


[11/28/2022 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It doesnt matter that youre black or gay or white or straight


[11/28/2022 11:31 PM] 5298_
I think equity can be good if done right, like for disabled people, they need more rights because of their disability to keep everything fair


[11/28/2022 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Of course for disabled people there can be an exception, they can be held at a higher standard because they need that higher standard to be on par


[11/28/2022 11:32 PM] 5298_
But giving say black people more rights because they used to be heavily discriminated against isn't equal or true equity


[11/28/2022 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but if youre an abled person then there shouldnt be special treatment or glorification of sexuality, gender or race


[11/28/2022 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I also dont understand why people protest in this country for rights, when everyone has the same rights


[11/28/2022 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Protesting against shit happening in other countries


[11/28/2022 11:33 PM] 5298_
It's because parliament wants to get rid of them


[11/28/2022 11:34 PM] 5298_
Parliament really wants to get rid of trans rights and their new rights acts say that we can't speak out against the union or parliament


[11/28/2022 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What are they getting rid of when it comes to trans rights


[11/28/2022 11:36 PM] 5298_
Allowing people to not give them jobs or places in college and university solely because of their identity is the main one

1 sources says rishi sunak plans on making sure that sex means biological sex but im yet to see evidence although i havent looked far


[11/28/2022 11:46 PM] 5298_
Sex does mean biological sex, the issues arise when people don't differentiate between sex and gender


[11/28/2022 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
All ive seen is he plans to review where trans rights stand in the equality act


[11/28/2022 11:47 PM] 5298_
I don't understand why people treat them differently


[11/28/2022 11:48 PM] 5298_
I only have a problem with this because it seems like a direct mockery of trans people

im not sure where i stand on it because it feels like it doesnt exist but i do believe people genuinely can be it


[11/28/2022 11:55 PM] 5298_
A fact I know about it is that a lot of non binary people are actually autistic ( not read half a BuzzFeed article and self diagnosed ) because they don't fully understand what gender is supposed to be


[11/28/2022 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Interesting


[11/28/2022 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theres one more thing i think and its controversial


[11/28/2022 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
children (people under the age of 18) should not be allowed hormone blockers and hormones


[11/28/2022 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But


[11/28/2022 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theres also an issue with that


[11/28/2022 11:56 PM] 5298_
That's not controversial, it's illegal to give a child hormones anyways


[11/28/2022 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But


[11/28/2022 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the nhs does it anyways


[11/28/2022 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
behind the parents back


[11/28/2022 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there are clinics dedicated to giving children hormones without parental consent


[11/28/2022 11:57 PM] 5298_
They can give hormone blockers and give them hormones if they have a hormone deficiency


[11/28/2022 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im talking about for children who have gender dysphoria


[11/28/2022 11:58 PM] 5298_
Yeah, that's illegal


[11/28/2022 11:59 PM] 5298_
You cannot give a gender dysphoric child any hormones, they can't have hormone blockers without parents and gender therapists consent and they also cannot have gender realignment surgery


[11/28/2022 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel like the whole lgbt thing is getting pushed too far because of shit like that


[11/29/2022 12:00 AM] 5298_

so silly from my end


[11/29/2022 8:48 PM] 5298_
Did you know there's a Schizophrenic man that posts videos of what he thinks might be illusions to see if they are or not and everyone in the comments says they're real when they aren't or just spam I'm in your walls


[11/29/2022 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know loads of people like that


[11/29/2022 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
record it on your phone and see if there are shadows and knocks


[11/29/2022 8:49 PM] 5298_
The shadows 100% aren't real


[11/29/2022 8:50 PM] 5298_
The only thing is deciding if it's an illusion or if my eyes are just shit

People think that misdiagnosing people as autistic is completely harmless and people should do it more


[11/29/2022 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wtf


[11/29/2022 9:53 PM] 5298_
I JUST SAW SOMEONE SAY PEOPLE NEED TO SEXUALISE AUTISM MORE


[11/29/2022 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WTF


[11/29/2022 9:54 PM] 5298_
We should keep Birmingham and put all these people there


[11/29/2022 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Something happened then


[11/29/2022 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it felt like there was great pressure on my chest for a few seconds and i couldnt breathe


[11/29/2022 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was horrible


[11/29/2022 10:04 PM] 5298_
That's happened to me before


[11/29/2022 10:04 PM] 5298_
I thought I was dying

Do you ever feel like you can't express emotions? Like you aren't allowed to?


[11/29/2022 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/29/2022 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
all the time


[11/29/2022 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

It wasnt just a clown


[11/29/2022 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was the entire circus


[11/29/2022 11:18 PM] 5298_
I'm not allowed to be angry, everyone treats being sad as the worst thing ever for some reason and I get called weird when I'm excited because I shake my hands


[11/29/2022 11:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I try not to cry in public, only in private


[11/29/2022 11:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel like its forced on me to keep my emotions in


[11/29/2022 11:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Anger is something mostly reserved for home


[11/29/2022 11:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sometimes at school it comes loose but it doesnt happen often


[11/29/2022 11:20 PM] 5298_
I've been told not to cry so when I start to I stop myself even though I don't want to


[11/29/2022 11:21 PM] 5298_
When I get angry it feels like my entire body is on fire and I need to hit something to stop it, that used to be people, then it was objects but I broke a bin so I can't do that anymore so now I just hit myself


[11/29/2022 11:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When i get pissed off i start hitting and attempting to destroy everything


[11/29/2022 11:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have hundreds of controllers in my house from when i used to get angry


[11/29/2022 11:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i broke my laptop multiple times and bent the keyboard inwards on it lmfao


[11/29/2022 11:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i broke a monitor


[11/29/2022 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ive calmed down a bit now but anger isnt something you can always control


[11/29/2022 11:23 PM] 5298_
I've nearly broken my hand a few times


[11/29/2022 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/29/2022 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
MY MUM TURNED OFF THE INTERNET TO RESET IT


[11/29/2022 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/29/2022 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
BUT MY MUM STOPPED ME


[11/29/2022 11:24 PM] 5298_
WHAT THE FUCK, WHY


[11/29/2022 11:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
CAUSE I WAS ANGRY


[11/29/2022 11:24 PM] 5298_
SO YOU TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF?


[11/29/2022 11:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes

[11/29/2022 11:25 PM] 5298_
I'm glad you didn't


[11/29/2022 11:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LIKE A FEW CENTIMETRES FROM BLEEDING OUT


[11/29/2022 11:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
MY MUM SCREAMED AT ME


[11/29/2022 11:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/29/2022 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/29/2022 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was so fucking ready to die too


[11/29/2022 11:27 PM] 5298_
I did beat the shit out of the shower yesterday though


[11/29/2022 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was accepting and waiting for the pain


[11/29/2022 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
FUCK YOU SHOWER KYS


[11/29/2022 11:29 PM] 5298_
Some retard took the lid off the shampoo and didn't put it back on and my hands were wet so when I tried to put the lid back on it kept slipping out my hands and I got really angry and nearly punched the shower door off its hinges


[11/29/2022 11:29 PM] 5298_

[11/29/2022 11:32 PM] 5298_
I want to go back to being Brittons, not British. Brittons were cool and based (I'm slowly learning youth slang ( I'm secretly 58 years old ) ), the British are cunts


[11/29/2022 11:34 PM] 5298_
Did I use based right?


[11/29/2022 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[11/29/2022 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Based pretty much means cool


[11/29/2022 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Theres a reason i mashed it up


[11/29/2022 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i fucked up my ankle


[11/29/2022 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont know how it just hurts when i move it to the left


[11/29/2022 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think i might be having heart failure


[11/29/2022 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
jk


[11/29/2022 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but im showing a couple fucking signs of it


[11/29/2022 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and my maternal family has a range of heart issues


[11/29/2022 11:52 PM] 5298_

[11/29/2022 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i dont care anymore about it


[11/29/2022 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i always used to not be able to sleep thinking i would die in it


[11/30/2022 12:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope world war 3 starts so this God forsaken collapsing country finally dies


[11/30/2022 12:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And America


[11/30/2022 12:18 AM] 5298_
I would prefer it after I'm dead though because I don't want to fight for England


[11/30/2022 12:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We aren't getting drafted at 13 and 14 unless the English are scraping the barrel for manpower like the third reich in its final months


[11/30/2022 12:19 AM] 5298_
Although we could get asylum in Ireland


[11/30/2022 12:20 AM] 5298_
It depends on how long the war is though, if it's the same as WW2 we would fight in the last two years


[11/30/2022 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We could recreate James dalys mutiny


[11/30/2022 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A ww3 would last for fucking ages because it seems to be russia and china


[11/30/2022 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And maybe north korea


[11/30/2022 12:22 AM] 5298_
WW3 would be quite similar to the cold war I think


[11/30/2022 12:23 AM] 5298_
Threats of destruction but mainly spying


[11/30/2022 12:23 AM] 5298_
Trying to take the countries down from the inside out


[11/30/2022 12:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The second cold War is happening noe


[11/30/2022 12:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Now


[11/30/2022 12:24 AM] 5298_
England would definitely fall if that's the case because they would deport all immigrants immediately so the economy would be very unstable


[11/30/2022 12:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'd say it's more tense than the cold War at this point


[11/30/2022 12:25 AM] 5298_
It would definitely be different to the first world wars


[11/30/2022 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It would be


[11/30/2022 12:25 AM] 5298_
Trench warfare is impossible now


[11/30/2022 12:26 AM] 5298_
Every country that owns a satellite could just watch the trench and then do a drone strike


[11/30/2022 12:27 AM] 5298_
I think WW3 would be the most interesting war ever


[11/30/2022 12:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There's trenches in ukraine


[11/30/2022 12:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You've probably seen thr video of the Russian guy in the trench and the drone starts dropping tiny bombs on him but he picks them up and throws them


[11/30/2022 12:30 AM] 5298_
I think if a world war was to start the west would crumble


[11/30/2022 12:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good


[11/30/2022 12:31 AM] 5298_
I hope Ireland would do the right thing and stay neutral


[11/30/2022 12:33 AM] 5298_
I think every single country should all declare peace except for France, then this new World Union will all declare war on France and blow it off the face of the Earth. Every single explosive on the planet will be used to destroy France


[11/30/2022 12:36 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wonder if ww3 will happen during blackouts


[11/30/2022 12:36 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That would be interesting

There is 13080000 tons of tnt equivalent in nukes across the planet


[11/30/2022 12:38 AM] 5298_
Do you think that could destroy a continent?


[11/30/2022 12:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe


[11/30/2022 12:39 AM] 5298_
You wake up one morning to hear that we got rid of North America


[11/30/2022 12:39 AM] 5298_
I think we could break Europe off of Asia with the amount of bombs we have


[11/30/2022 12:40 AM] 5298_
If every country sent all their bombs to the European border we could crack it off


[11/30/2022 12:40 AM] 5298_
Or at least make a fucking huge canal

I've slept since I got home


[11/30/2022 9:39 PM] 5298_
And now I've been told to sleep I can't


[11/30/2022 9:39 PM] 5298_
I also haven't had anything to eat all day and I can't go get something now


[11/30/2022 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[11/30/2022 9:41 PM] 5298_
I've just beaten the shit out of my leg


[11/30/2022 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why you have you performed an action which injures your leg?


[11/30/2022 9:42 PM] 5298_
Because I'm pissed off


[11/30/2022 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Just stop being pissed off it aint that hard (for entertainment purposes this statement is purely comedic and has no ill intent)


[11/30/2022 9:43 PM] 5298_
I'm fucking starving


[11/30/2022 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sneak downstairs


[11/30/2022 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then make 99% tomato soup


[11/30/2022 9:43 PM] 5298_
I don't like tomatoes or soup


[11/30/2022 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and 1% cyanide


[11/30/2022 9:43 PM] 5298_
And we also have neither in the house


[11/30/2022 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont like tomatoes but i like tomato soup


[11/30/2022 9:44 PM] 5298_
My parents room is downstairs


[11/30/2022 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Go into their room and say "mother, pretend you are currently sleeping and i am not downstairs trying to create a 10 course meal to consume"


[11/30/2022 9:47 PM] 5298_
I have a two litre bottle of Pepsi Max in my room so I'm going to drink that and hope it makes me full and not hungry


[11/30/2022 9:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
coke and that can make you feel a little more full


[11/30/2022 9:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Milk does


[11/30/2022 9:48 PM] 5298_
Honestly at this point I'm thinking about going into Danielle's room and eating the frozen food from her fridge ( don't ask why she has a fridge in her room )


[11/30/2022 9:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmao


[11/30/2022 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
do you reckon we could make a hybrid of english and welsh


[11/30/2022 10:07 PM] 5298_
I reckon you could, the extent of my language skills is some basic entomology


[11/30/2022 10:25 PM] 5298_

Discord had a new creator feature and people are apparently making thousands off it


[12/01/2022 11:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what is it


[12/01/2022 11:45 PM] 5298_
People can subscribe in creators  servers to get special features and access


[12/01/2022 11:46 PM] 5298_
If Panmathisa takes off we could make one, make extra money


[12/01/2022 11:47 PM] 5298_
Fucking hell YouTube has a small income


[12/01/2022 11:47 PM] 5298_
Around ¬£3 per 1000 view


[12/01/2022 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats 30 quid every 10k views 300 quid every 100k and 3000 quid every 1 million


[12/01/2022 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive had a video get 89k views before i just wasnt monetised


[12/01/2022 11:48 PM] 5298_
Fair enough


[12/01/2022 11:48 PM] 5298_
How does it even work?


[12/01/2022 11:49 PM] 5298_
Is it total views of that month?


[12/01/2022 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
For that video


[12/01/2022 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It ticks up with every view


[12/01/2022 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You can withdraw your money whenever you want


[12/01/2022 11:50 PM] 5298_
So if you get 100k views in one month then 10k extra the next month on the same video you would get ¬£300 then another ¬£30 not ¬£300 and then ¬£330


[12/01/2022 11:51 PM] 5298_
Money's money I'm not complaining


[12/01/2022 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You withdraw the money whenever its not monthly


[12/01/2022 11:52 PM] 5298_
If Panmathisa makes money do you want to be in charge of the money?


[12/01/2022 11:52 PM] 5298_
I have no idea how it works


[12/01/2022 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont know


[12/01/2022 11:52 PM] 5298_
You can withdraw it and split it 50/50

[12/02/2022 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dylan


[12/02/2022 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
do you think the universe existed before the big bang


[12/02/2022 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
as a singularity


[12/02/2022 12:05 AM] 5298_
I believe in the big crunch, the universe is just like a big heart, it expands out then it goes back in and restarts


[12/02/2022 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I believe that too


[12/02/2022 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The whole mutual gravity thing makes so much fucking sense


[12/02/2022 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
at the moment we're still in the early stages of the universe, so everything is accelerating away from us


[12/02/2022 12:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but eventually everything has to slow down because of gravity


[12/02/2022 12:07 AM] 5298_
Someone should write a book about a cosmic entity with weird things as organs, like a universe for a heart

How do we know that the whole universe isnt infinite


[12/02/2022 12:08 AM] 5298_
We don't but I believe it to help me sleep at night


[12/02/2022 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the observable universe is only "expanding" because light is moving further away from us


[12/02/2022 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and also


[12/02/2022 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/02/2022 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
anyways


[12/02/2022 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In fact they dont know if its infinite or not


[12/02/2022 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thank god


[12/02/2022 12:10 AM] 5298_
That's what I said


[12/02/2022 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know


[12/02/2022 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i double checked


[12/02/2022 12:11 AM] 5298_
I need to believe the universe is infinite or my brain will melt


[12/02/2022 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IF THE UNIVERSE IS INFINITE


[12/02/2022 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
THERE IS INFINITE MES


[12/02/2022 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
AND THERE IS INFINITE EARTHS WHICH ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL OTHER THAN IRELAND BEING UNITED

[12/02/2022 6:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Academy or walney


[12/02/2022 6:35 PM] 5298_
Academy would be worse than Bernards


[12/02/2022 6:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why would it


[12/02/2022 6:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Bernards is a school that doesnt follow its own standards


[12/02/2022 6:36 PM] 5298_

It was the year 2052 and Barrow-in-Furness, a once peaceful town in the northern part of England, had suffered an extremely draconian rule over the past years. The people of Barrow-in-Furness were oppressed and relegated to a state of suffering and misery; their simple lives were ruined by a corrupt government that had been in power since 2026. The town was now ruled by a ruthless dictator, Jason Wilbanks, and his tyrannical regime.

Rylan O'Neill, Will Hunt, and Reece McDonald were three rebels, brought up in a town living in a state of devastation and despair. Rylan was a young man, with a fierce determination, passion for justice and a thirst for adventure. He had an infectious optimism which he used to motivate his comrades. He had been a close friend of Will Hunt since childhood, and was determined to bring an end to the oppressive regime once and for all. Will, on the other hand, was the strategist of the trio, with a sharp analytical mind and a cool head. He accepted the risks that came with rebellion, but was always sure to manage the risks effectively for the greater good. 

Reece McDonald was the third of the rebels; a magnetic character and a natural leader. His impressive aptitude for communication and charisma made him an inspirational figure within the town. He mobilized a multitude of people under the cause and was determined to bring about a revolution.


[12/04/2022 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The trio had devised a plan to liberate Barrow-in-Furness from the dictator's rule. After months of preparation, their battle ensued. The rebels swept through the former dictator's palace, and with willpower and courage, the trio valiantly claimed the area from the oppressive rule. 

Finally, after years of misery, the people of Barrow-in-Furness were liberated. As Rylan, Will, and Reece were hailed as heroes, they could feel an immense sense of pride, knowing that this was the result of their fearless and unrelenting efforts. 

The citizens of Barrow-in-Furness were eternally grateful to their pioneers, whom had brought a much-needed sense of hope and freedom to the town. The terrible era had finally come to an end, and the small town of Barrow-in-Furness could look forward to a new, bright future. 

It was a beautiful story of courage, heroism and the relentless pursuit of freedom. Little did any of them know, this was only the beginning for the trio, for their relentless drive for justice was about to take them to new heights.

Chorus:
From the Hills to the East,
West, the Irish Sea,
Stands a Nation Free,
Oh Sweet North Walney!

Verse 1:
The beauty of the North you can clearly see, 
You won't find any match to its Land, Sky and Sea,
Those down South they cannot know, 
What they think they cannot show.

Verse 2:
Rolling hills to the East, sway in a gentle breeze,
The snows come to crown the year, so you may find peace,
From Firths to the far away isles, 
A Nation we have forged with toil.

Verse 3:
The stunning Irish Sea it crashes to the Shore,
An ocean of life, loud with pomp and roar,
A single Oath and no more strife,
A Nation Beloved, A Nation of North Walney!

Chorus: 
From the Hills to the East,
West, the Irish Sea,
Stands a Nation Free,
Oh Sweet North Walney!

Verse 4:
Stout and proud, North Walney strives,
As we raise our flag with pride, 
Tired of the South's foolish ways,
What fools these mortals be. 

Verse 5:
Countries near we have embraced,
Peaceful commerce and fraternity grace,
Come one and all, join in the cause,
The inspiration of North Walney's laws!

Chorus:
From the Hills to the East,
West, the Irish Sea,
Stands a Nation Free,
Oh Sweet North Walney!

Chorus:
O Walney we sing of sweet liberty
And come together united in harmony
Green, blue, and white waving through the wind
Blessed are our united homeland

Verse 2:
The banner flies with green, blue, and white
Forging a bond between day and night 
Consolidating hearts and souls
As we stand to reach our common goals. 

Chorus:
O Walney we sing of sweet liberty
And come together united in harmony
Green, blue, and white waving through the wind
Blessed are our united homeland 

Verse 3:
A dream of peace rises up in view
Watch it swirl and twirl, dancing through
All across our fair Walneyland
Our united banner takes a stand.

Chorus:
O Walney we sing of sweet liberty
And come together united in harmony
Green, blue, and white waving through the wind
Blessed are our united homeland

for when walney eventually has to unite


[12/04/2022 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good evening, citizens of North Walney 

Today, I am here to address the ongoing situation with South Walney, which threatens the peace and stability of this Island. As you all may know, back in October, the Republic of Walney, our united nation, held an election that sought to remove power from the North. As a result of the President, Reece McDonald, and his government's actions, this prompted our nation to declare independence. It was clear that they only cared for themselves.

Recently, it was noted that South Walney has been building an enormous, intimidating force on the border, that threatens to disrupt the peace and stability of the island. As such, I recommend the government of South Walney remove their troops immediately, as nobody wants to go down a path of death and destruction which a war would bring. 

Furthermore, we mustn't forget the oppression the North has faced from the South. During, the elections, the South Walnesian government denied the basic right to vote, to citizens of the North. This act will never be forgotten, for the significance it holds to us. We shall not let the South Rule over us with an Iron Fist, like they did for many years. We must stand together, to ensure us, as people, shall continue to live on, not oppressed, nor shall we oppress.

Thank you,
President Rylan JC O'Neill

[12/04/2022 11:52 PM] 5298_
Barrows doing quite well


[12/04/2022 11:53 PM] 5298_
We still need to officially unite Barrow and Walney


[12/04/2022 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good idea


[12/04/2022 11:54 PM] 5298_

[12/04/2022 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we dont unite as countries, but rather through an economic and military alliance


[12/05/2022 12:00 AM] 5298_
Yeah


[12/05/2022 12:00 AM] 5298_
Not like the UK where it's a merge of countries but more like the EU


[12/05/2022 12:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/05/2022 12:02 AM] 5298_

Not sure pal


[12/05/2022 12:04 AM] 5298_
Should we start with why we're unifying?


[12/05/2022 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/05/2022 12:05 AM] 5298_
Why can't I fucking type


[12/05/2022 12:10 AM] 5298_
How's that?


[12/05/2022 12:12 AM] 5298_
Don't we need to write out the conditions of the agreement


[12/05/2022 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/05/2022 12:14 AM] 5298_
Should we start with the economic agreements?


[12/05/2022 12:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ok


[12/05/2022 12:14 AM] 5298_
Do you have any suggestions?


[12/05/2022 12:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Idk


[12/05/2022 12:15 AM] 5298_
What currency should we use?


[12/05/2022 12:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Walnesian Pound


[12/05/2022 12:16 AM] 5298_
No additional tax for international trade?


[12/05/2022 12:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Go on then


[12/05/2022 12:22 AM] 5298_
I'm going to leave it at that because I can't be arsed


[12/05/2022 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh, we love you Reece McDonald
You¬¥re the leader of us all
You¬¥re the curse of the Walney Nation
People dread your every call
You¬¥ve destroyed our local businesses
And you put us on the dole
If I could get my hands on you
I¬¥d kick you up the hole

Oh, we love you Reece McDonald
You¬¥re the brightest one of all
But your policies are bankrupt
No one trusts you at the hall
You¬¥ve taken from the poor to give
To your rich and greedy friends
You can keep their wealth Reece McDonald
You can stick it up your ends

Oh, we love you Reece McDonald
You ¬¥re the cleverest one around
But your decisions are so crooked
That we all feel so bound
When you hold negotiations
No one's ever heard a pitch
You¬¥re the reason for the ruin
Such a schemer the young bitch

Oh, we love you Reece McDonald
With your taxes rising high
And the work is getting awful scarce
We¬¥re losing that¬¥s no lie
Now you say that you will not stay
You¬¥ve been here long enough
If I were the taxidermist
I would tell you to get stuffed

Oh, we love you Reece McDonald
Sure you know a trick or two
And when you come to Vickerstown
Well we all know what to do
You¬¥ll dress up in your finery
And preach with all your might
But all your fancy promises
Are just a load of shite

Oh, we love you Reece McDonald
Like your old man likes the booze
Such a scoundrel your Joe Biden
When he¬¥s had a drink or two
He¬¥ll take a pint of Whiskey
and a glass of Stella Artois
And because he sleeps with you each night
no wonder he's so pissed

[12/05/2022 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh we love you Rylan O'Neill
You're the president of us all
You're the curse of the Walney people
For North Walney, soon shall fall
You love the IRA and terror
And you want to be in charge
If I could get my hands on you
I'd kick you up the arse

Oh, we love you Rylan O'Neill
You're a menace to our town
You'll put us in a panic
With your fascist-like renown
You want to take away our rights
And oppress us with your rule
If I could get my hands on you
I'd beat you with a tool

Oh, we love you Rylan O'Neill
You're a danger to us all
You'll take away our freedom
And put us in a wall
You want to see us suffer
And make us all downtrodden
If I could get my hands on you
I'd kick you up the puddin'

Oh, we love you Rylan O'Neill
You're a menace to the state
You'll take away our rights
And never hesitate
You'll put us all in danger
And make us all afraid
If I could get my hands on you
I'd kick you up the shade

Oh, we love you Rylan O'Neill
You'll be sure to take away
The rights of the Walney people
And let us have no say
You'll take away our freedom
And make us all a slave
If I could get my hands on you
I'd kick you in the cave


[12/05/2022 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

In fact, cumbria is bigger than 12 european countries


[12/05/2022 12:57 AM] 5298_
Cumbria needs to be independent or a part of Scotland

[12/06/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I agree to an extent


[12/06/2022 8:32 PM] 5298_

[12/06/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No side in a war is good


[12/06/2022 8:33 PM] 5298_
You agree that maybe the FUCKING NAZI'S weren't all that bad


[12/06/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[12/06/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont agree


[12/06/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
youre taking my statement out of context


[12/06/2022 8:33 PM] 5298_
When it's a war against fascism and eugenics I think a side might be good


[12/06/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Most of the people fighting in the wehrmacht werent as bad as you think


[12/06/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they werent aware of the concentration camps


[12/06/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
some were conscripted


[12/06/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
didnt have a choice


[12/06/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Those people who didnt have a choice but yet were forced to kill can be forgiven


[12/06/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its the SS and Hitlers government etc who cant be


[12/06/2022 8:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No side of war is perfect no matter what, both commit war crimes


[12/06/2022 8:35 PM] 5298_
I'm not saying the entire German army was bad, I'm saying the Nazis as an ideology and regime were obviously the bad side of the war


[12/06/2022 8:35 PM] 5298_
But it's still quite obvious that the alis were far better than the axis


[12/06/2022 8:36 PM] 5298_
Maybe less so America


[12/06/2022 8:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
France and Britain were against German expansion because they wanted to consolidate power


[12/06/2022 8:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But the germans werent good


[12/06/2022 8:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i fucking hate the nazis


[12/06/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They're stupid cunts


[12/06/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im talking before the war here


[12/06/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not during


[12/06/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the allies were the good side


[12/06/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But the fucking fact is the allies helped the germans to the extent by using appeasement


[12/06/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They gave countries territories away without asking them about it


[12/06/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Peoples rights


[12/06/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/06/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
anyways


[12/06/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im starting to ramble and lose my original point


[12/06/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i will stop now


[12/06/2022 8:38 PM] 5298_
Britain and France are obviously shit anyways, but during WW2 they were clearly fighting for the right side


[12/06/2022 8:39 PM] 5298_
But Britain and France have been shit for centuries, long before Nazism was coined


[12/06/2022 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The polish werent perfect though they invaded czechoslovakia


[12/06/2022 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/08/2022 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dont know if we are well equipped


[12/08/2022 8:40 PM] 5298_
We live in a ""democracy"" Rylan, if we rally enough people we could at least try and inject socialism into UK politics, and maybe even persuade more people to vote for SNP and Plaid Cymru


[12/08/2022 8:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dont know if that would work pal


[12/08/2022 8:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we are 13 and 14 respectively


[12/08/2022 8:41 PM] 5298_
Yes we are, but there are people our age that are making a difference in the world


[12/08/2022 8:42 PM] 5298_
Ms. Thunberg for one, different cause but she's still young making a difference


[12/08/2022 8:43 PM] 5298_
I have to try at least


[12/08/2022 8:44 PM] 5298_
There's so much right-wing influence everywhere, we need to add some left-wing

[12/12/2022 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i would love to try it out

I think if I had a knife and the skills to use it I would feel safe at night


[12/12/2022 8:34 PM] 5298_

[12/12/2022 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Just fucking leaving and walking around Barrow


[12/12/2022 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to do that


[12/12/2022 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If I escaped I'd hide deep in the abbey or something and make a den


[12/12/2022 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Try and find the furthest point from a path


[12/12/2022 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The police are pretty much immediately involved if you walk out though because legally the school acts as a guardian figure to you when you're there


[12/12/2022 10:43 PM] 5298_
I'll see what I have tomorrow and if it makes me want to kill myself let's just not go in, school is fucking hell. I know I need to go to get good grades and shit but at this point I don't think I'm going to even if I stay in school, and me as a person just lack most skills employers want

[12/12/2022 10:48 PM] 5298_
I can't work in groups, I can't talk to people, I can't listen, if I don't want to do something I just wont


[12/12/2022 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can talk to people, but only people I trust


[12/12/2022 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm very social in school because I know I can trust everyone in our year and some in the year below


[12/12/2022 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But outside of school I don't talk and try not to make eye contact with people because it feels horrible


[12/12/2022 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate school it's horrible


[12/12/2022 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I fucking hate it

At the back of the field I don't think there's a fence


[12/12/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There is


[12/12/2022 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But it should be easy to get over


[12/12/2022 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No cameras there and also the fence is the shitty green fence


[12/12/2022 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probably not a great idea


[12/12/2022 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/12/2022 10:58 PM] 5298_
I don't want to go to school and I want to just leave for the day but I know when I got home my mother would fucking kill me


[12/12/2022 10:59 PM] 5298_
I wouldn't go in in the first place, I'd get dropped off and as soon as my grandad drives off just leave

I want a knife


[12/13/2022 8:29 PM] 5298_
But no one would buy me a knife


[12/13/2022 8:39 PM] 5298_
After winter we should go to some woods somewhere and do some bushcraft


[12/13/2022 8:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Agreed


[12/13/2022 8:53 PM] 5298_
Over the Easter Holidays let's just fucking go somewhere, walk up the beach and follow the first river we see and try and find somewhere cool. If I can persuade my parents to let me buy a knife we could make spears and bows and shit. They sell some form of string in Dutton's I think that might be strong enough for a bow


[12/13/2022 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Agreed


[12/13/2022 8:59 PM] 5298_
I would try to make a rock sling but I don't have the leather for it

Sunak is a fucking joke, a Scottish MP asked him how Scotland could leave the UK because they voted that they wanted to leave but they couldn't, and he just ignored her and said that they need Scotland to help the economy

Up to mighty London came
An Irish man one day
All the streets were paved with gold
So everyone was gay!
Singing songs of Piccadilly
Strand, and Leicester Square
'Til Paddy got excited and
He shouted to them there:
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye Piccadilly
Farewell Leicester Square!
It's a long long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there.
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye Piccadilly
Farewell Leicester Square!
It's a long long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there.
Paddy wrote a letter
To his Irish Molly O'
Saying, "Should you not receive it
Write and let me know!
If I make mistakes in "spelling"
Molly dear", said he
"Remember it's the pen, that's bad
Don't lay the blame on me".
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye Piccadilly
Farewell Leicester Square
It's a long long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there.
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye Piccadilly
Farewell Leicester Square
It's a long long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there.

[12/14/2022 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But its from the taste


[12/14/2022 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/14/2022 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they taste like shit


[12/14/2022 9:37 PM] 5298_
It's the texture of them


[12/14/2022 9:38 PM] 5298_
They make me want to die

[12/14/2022 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WE NEED JEWS TO CONTROL WEATHER AND MAKE VERY FROSTY


[12/14/2022 10:00 PM] 5298_
What does that mean


[12/14/2022 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its satire because theres people who think the jews control the world and weather


[12/14/2022 10:01 PM] 5298_
Fucking what


[12/14/2022 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Did you not know that


[12/14/2022 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought wendigoon wouldve talked about that shit on his videos about stupid conspiracy theories


[12/14/2022 10:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Alcoholic drinks taste fucking disgusting


[12/14/2022 10:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and smoking and that isnt appealling to me cause its dirty as fuck


[12/14/2022 10:03 PM] 5298_
I've not had one in about a decade


[12/14/2022 10:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe i will get pissed in my life but for the most part i dont want to drink


[12/14/2022 10:04 PM] 5298_
The concept just seems awful, burning cancer plants and breathing it


[12/14/2022 10:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik


[12/14/2022 10:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I used to vape sometimes but never got addicted and strayed completely away from the idea when i realised how fucking stupid and not cool it is


[12/14/2022 10:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might as well get a drink or something


[12/14/2022 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like that fucking barr bubblegum drink


[12/14/2022 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
very nice drink


[12/14/2022 10:06 PM] 5298_
I don't like the thought of not being in control of my mind


[12/14/2022 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[12/14/2022 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im scared of getting addicted to something


[12/14/2022 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Specifically something that causes harm to me


[12/14/2022 10:08 PM] 5298_
Yeah, I would like to not kill myself slowly


[12/14/2022 10:09 PM] 5298_
If I'm to kill myself I'd like it to be a conscious and quick event


[12/14/2022 10:09 PM] 5298_
Not a slow necessity


[12/14/2022 10:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Agreed


[12/14/2022 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wouldnt like to jump off a building either


[12/14/2022 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the feeling of falling is fucking horrible


[12/14/2022 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i hate it


[12/14/2022 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so uch


[12/14/2022 10:12 PM] 5298_
I would actually like to jump off a cliff if I was going to kill myself


[12/14/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wouldnt


[12/14/2022 10:13 PM] 5298_
I'd like the sky to fill my vision as I die


[12/14/2022 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The feeling is the worst and there is always the chance you manage to live


[12/14/2022 10:13 PM] 5298_
Land on your neck


[12/14/2022 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it depends on the height of the object youre jumping off


[12/14/2022 10:14 PM] 5298_
I want to make a bow and arrow


[12/14/2022 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like if you were to jump off a skyscraper youd just be spinning


[12/14/2022 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i want to do bushcraftery now


[12/14/2022 10:14 PM] 5298_
Is it legal to make a fire


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If its controlled


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] 5298_
Like, in the forest


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
doesnt matter


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i used to do it all the time


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we put stones around them


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
obviously


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fires can still start that


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
way


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but the risk is reduced a bit


[12/14/2022 10:15 PM] 5298_
Because you need a fire to make arrows


[12/14/2022 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How so, for the flint top?


[12/14/2022 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm assuming so


[12/14/2022 10:19 PM] 5298_
I think I've been lied to


[12/14/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[12/14/2022 10:19 PM] 5298_
You just need a notch and a suitable rock


[12/14/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why would you need fire


[12/14/2022 10:19 PM] 5298_
I don't think you need a fire


[12/14/2022 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[12/14/2022 10:20 PM] 5298_
I thought you had to burn the edge slightly


[12/14/2022 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why though


[12/14/2022 10:21 PM] 5298_
I don't know, I thought it was to do with keeping the arrowhead in place

If I had a bow and arrow I would use it to kill birds


[12/14/2022 10:22 PM] 5298_
You can use the feathers for more arrows and the meat for food


[12/14/2022 10:23 PM] 5298_
The bones can also be used as small throwing knives for small game catching


[12/14/2022 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/14/2022 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/14/2022 10:27 PM] 5298_
I would feel horrible for killing a bird but I think I would still do it


[12/14/2022 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same i feel horrible for killing most things


[12/14/2022 10:27 PM] 5298_
I'd need to build up a resilience for it

In billions of years parts of me that would have been completely disintegrated and scattered around the earth by plate tectonics and shit will be floating around the universe and i might become part of a new star or planet


[12/15/2022 6:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
also it is believed there was a fifth gas giant in our solar system that is probably flying around somewhere in the galaxy rn lmao


[12/15/2022 6:25 PM] 5298_
Imagine Earth did that


[12/15/2022 6:25 PM] 5298_

[12/15/2022 6:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That would be rather terrifying


[12/15/2022 6:26 PM] 5298_
It would be a great way to die


[12/15/2022 6:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"Because the Fifth Giant hasn‚Äôt yet been found elsewhere in the Milky Way, there are many theories that suggest what happened to the missing planet. One theory suggests that the Fifth Giant was ripped apart because of the lack of the gravitational pull from a parent star a few thousand years after it was ejected. Another theory suggests that it was captured by a nearby star system and became an exoplanet in disguise, and many it's already discovered but we just don't know it yet."


[12/15/2022 6:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If it was ejected 4.48 billion years ago it would have travelled fucking ages by now

Me and a few other people all over England left society and went to an agreed upon location in the Scottish forest, the people from Cumbria all got there and we started with splitting ourselves into different groups, toolsmiths, hunters, cooks, builders, sowers and gardeners, we then got to work, the toolsmiths making spears and knives and bows for the hunters to go get food for everyone, the builders started making the camp and making the fire, the gardeners looked around for anything to grow and the cooks and sowers waited for the hunters to get back. Then it was basically a socialist utopia, everyone working for the good of everyone, no greed, the hunters got meat and hyde for the camp, the cooks made a fair amount of food for everyone, the builders made places for everyone to live, the sowers made clothes out of the hyde for everyone. It was like clockwork it was amazing. Then when people from further around the country like the south and Wales came we adjusted accordingly


[12/15/2022 6:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
very awesome dream if i do say so myself

[12/15/2022 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
EVEN THO I WILL BE ZONED OUT FOR AT LEAST 75% OF THE TEST


[12/15/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
BECAUSE ONE QUESTION WILL MAKE ME START THINKING ABOUT WHY THE UNIVERSE WAS MADE


[12/15/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IT ALL STARTS WITH ONE QUESTION


[12/15/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think


[12/15/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
HOW DID MATHS START


[12/15/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i think WHY DO WE NOT USE OTHER NUMBER SYSTEMS


[12/15/2022 9:22 PM] 5298_
Just repeat the grade you want in your head, that's what helps me

[12/15/2022 9:24 PM] 5298_
Well it's a weird mark scheme this year so as long as you do better than the other lower sets you'll get a high grade

DOES IT MEAN THAT SOMETHING GOOD HAS TO HAVE BEEN FOUND


[12/15/2022 9:59 PM] 5298_

not sure let me think


[12/15/2022 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so you are voluntarily not having children


[12/15/2022 10:36 PM] 5298_

[12/15/2022 11:31 PM] 5298_
The occasion is few and the few times it happens there's a large space of time between them, so it's far between the few or "few and far between"

What's wrong with Jay Steele


[12/16/2022 3:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He's a fucking knobhead he keeps telling me there's nothing wrong with me and that he's surprised that camhs actually accepted me and should reconsider that


[12/16/2022 3:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He doesn't fucking know me the dirty weird cunt


[12/16/2022 3:50 PM] 5298_
Well that's a bit fucking stupid


[12/16/2022 3:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know the fucking cunt I nearly started battering him today in the middle of dodgeball


[12/16/2022 3:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Hope his nan gets hit by a tractor then submerged into a giant pot of boiling sugar water then having it all removed then she gets molten tarmac poured over her then ripped off, tearing the first layer of her skin off before she gets submerged into a pot of ethanol then removed so she's in complete agony then set on fire

[12/16/2022 6:40 PM] 5298_
I just want to know about the specifics of tomorrow


[12/16/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill try get up early but i cant guarantee it


[12/16/2022 6:42 PM] 5298_
Where are we meeting? St. Francis' Church? When are we meeting? What specifically do you want to do?


[12/16/2022 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if i get up late we should go at like 2-3pm but if im up early im down for 11-12


[12/16/2022 6:43 PM] 5298_
I was thinking around 11 because sunset is really early


[12/16/2022 6:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure where we should meet


[12/16/2022 6:44 PM] 5298_
Are we going to How Tun Woods?


[12/16/2022 6:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think ive only been there once lmao


[12/16/2022 6:44 PM] 5298_
If so, we could meet at St Francis' or you could meet me at my house


[12/16/2022 6:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
is it big and dense enough for a den


[12/16/2022 6:45 PM] 5298_
There's a hidden area I know how to get to and loads of loose wood I know how to find, it's a place I know really well


[12/16/2022 6:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We'll go there then palestinian


[12/16/2022 6:45 PM] 5298_
I'm not from Palestine


[12/16/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ITS JUST MY WAY OF SAYING PAL


[12/16/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
YOU PALESTINIAN

[12/16/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Sowerby wood looks quite big


[12/16/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive not been there before but my dads dog got his leg bit through to the bone there


[12/16/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats not a joke either


[12/16/2022 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Look at how dense sowerby woods is

[12/16/2022 6:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
One issue


[12/16/2022 6:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
a trianline runs right through it


[12/16/2022 6:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
train


[12/16/2022 6:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and so do powerlines


[12/16/2022 6:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so we should probably do how tun


[12/16/2022 6:47 PM] 5298_
I've been there before I think


[12/16/2022 6:48 PM] 5298_
Sowerby is really good but I think How Tun is better just because none goes there and I know it better than Sowerby


[12/16/2022 6:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
good idea


[12/16/2022 6:48 PM] 5298_
So, 11-ish, meet at my house and go to How Tun


[12/16/2022 6:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ILL TRY BE AWAKE EARLY, BUT IF NOT YOU WILL PROBABLY KNOW FROM A LACK OF CONVERSING


[12/16/2022 6:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IF WORST COMES TO WORST


[12/16/2022 6:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WE HAVE TO SET OFF LATER


[12/16/2022 6:49 PM] 5298_
What do we plan to do, what does make a den entail. I want to try and learn any necessary skills

[12/16/2022 6:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But i want a den which is quite spacious, has walls and a roof which arent one thing


[12/16/2022 6:56 PM] 5298_
Something like this

[12/16/2022 6:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
YES


[12/16/2022 6:56 PM] 5298_
If we had a shovel we could try a dig out in Sowerby


[12/16/2022 6:59 PM] 5298_
They take ages though and a lot of materials


[12/16/2022 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/16/2022 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That den looks fucking awesome


[12/16/2022 7:00 PM] 5298_
It would be awesome though


[12/16/2022 7:00 PM] 5298_
Let's try and make that one


[12/16/2022 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Agreed


[12/16/2022 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also, me lucus and cole used to go down the docks and we found a rusty shovel


[12/16/2022 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we then tried to make a den but the soil was too firm


[12/16/2022 7:01 PM] 5298_
If we get up early we can look around How Tun and find a good spot and if there isn't one we could go to Sowerby, I think I've found a good rough location on Google maps

[12/16/2022 7:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What is your idea which your brain has produced


[12/16/2022 7:07 PM] 5298_
We have a box of matches in the house, I could attempt to borrow them for a fire, we _need_ to ensure it is a safe and controlled fire though. I'll be bringing a bottle of water ready to put any fires out or at least stop them from spreading


[12/16/2022 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is a good idea


[12/16/2022 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should only keep the fire in order to keep us warm


[12/16/2022 7:07 PM] 5298_
Because I wouldn't mind staying warm but I don't want to commit arson


[12/16/2022 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[12/16/2022 7:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we should try make some log seats to sit around it too


[12/16/2022 7:08 PM] 5298_
Yeah, it's just so we don't freeze to death, our hands will thank us for it. They'll be in a lot of pain from doing all that labour in the freezing cold


[12/16/2022 7:09 PM] 5298_
That's also why I wanted to get up earlier, so we can work mainly in sunlight


[12/16/2022 7:11 PM] 5298_
If you still have that shovel we could make a fire hole


[12/16/2022 7:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nope


[12/16/2022 7:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It got STOLEN


[12/16/2022 7:11 PM] 5298_
Although it would be worse for heat


[12/16/2022 7:11 PM] 5298_
That's not very nice


[12/16/2022 7:12 PM] 5298_
How are your fire safety skills?


[12/16/2022 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
SHIT


[12/16/2022 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i used to always make them with will hunt


[12/16/2022 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we used to set fire to bins and that lmfao


[12/16/2022 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we have a little pond over walney and we made a fire there


[12/16/2022 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
on the concrete path


[12/16/2022 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we got loads of dead grass and it made a fire


[12/16/2022 7:13 PM] 5298_
I'm alright with fire safety, we did it a lot when I did cubs


[12/16/2022 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which was actually kinda big at some point


[12/16/2022 7:18 PM] 5298_
Are we making any tools


[12/16/2022 7:19 PM] 5298_
I wanted to make a knife but I don't think we can


[12/16/2022 7:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should try


[12/16/2022 7:21 PM] 5298_
What do you propose we make a flaker out of


[12/16/2022 7:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Rocks


[12/16/2022 7:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Smash them up


[12/16/2022 7:21 PM] 5298_
Do you know how to make a knife?


[12/16/2022 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same process as a flaker if i had to guess


[12/16/2022 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but make it a little more narrow


[12/16/2022 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and maybe thicker?

A flaker is supposed to be a very fine tool you can use with precision, typically they're pieces of antler or you buy copper flakers, I don't have either of those

[12/16/2022 7:26 PM] 5298_
You make stone knives much sharper with a flaker but giving the edges teeth but the knife you have proposed seems like it will do nicely


[12/16/2022 7:29 PM] 5298_
Also what should the handle be for that knife


[12/16/2022 7:30 PM] 5298_
I'm beginning to think we should do it in Sowerby


[12/16/2022 7:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Use any dead grass or stuff we find


[12/16/2022 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im honeslty not sure


[12/16/2022 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but we want it to be comfortable to hold


[12/16/2022 7:32 PM] 5298_
Sowerby has much more forest and a lot less dog walkers and children than How Tun, at least I believe so and we have easy access to the sea to find rocks and stones


[12/16/2022 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Slight issue


[12/16/2022 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
train line


[12/16/2022 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and theres only 1 road that cuts through it


[12/16/2022 7:33 PM] 5298_
We can have a look in Dutton's arts and crafts are for string and things

I'm thinking we do it somewhere from that x along the line

[12/16/2022 7:35 PM] 5298_
So we have easy access to the sea


[12/16/2022 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
AGREEDON


[12/16/2022 7:35 PM] 5298_
The closer to the x we are the less likely farmers are to see or hear us but the further from the sea we are


[12/16/2022 7:36 PM] 5298_
So unless we bring bags and carry the stones up to an agreed location be might have some trouble


[12/16/2022 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
why are farmers such knobheads


[12/16/2022 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its literally public land


[12/16/2022 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and that deep in the forest shouldnt be affecting animals


[12/16/2022 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
unless theyve been allowed out


[12/16/2022 7:38 PM] 5298_
I've stolen two plastic carrier bags from Ms. Mulvey so we should be able to carry all the stones we need up to a deeper part of the wood


[12/16/2022 7:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/16/2022 7:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
also i have a question

couldnt danielle be considered an npc

[12/16/2022 7:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
how tf does she memorise things if she literally can not think


[12/16/2022 7:39 PM] 5298_
She doesn't

[12/16/2022 7:39 PM] 5298_

[12/16/2022 7:40 PM] 5298_
I would advise setting an alarm or two so you wake up at the desired time so we can make good use of the day


[12/16/2022 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I normally SLEEP THROUGH alarms


[12/16/2022 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
buit


[12/16/2022 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im hoping the fact i have to wake up early for school will at least wake me up like it normally doe


[12/16/2022 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
does


[12/16/2022 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
on a weekend


[12/16/2022 7:41 PM] 5298_
Meet me outside Dutton's


[12/16/2022 7:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
agreed


[12/16/2022 7:42 PM] 5298_
Is there anything we should bring aside the two bags and water ( save one bottle for fire emergency )


[12/16/2022 7:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not particulary


[12/16/2022 7:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao im not sure


[12/16/2022 7:43 PM] 5298_
If you have any items for fire starting in your home I would recommend bringing them because I won't be able to get the matches


[12/16/2022 7:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
alr


[12/16/2022 7:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think i do


[12/16/2022 7:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and my mum will not lend me a lighter because she will think im smoking or something


[12/16/2022 7:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nor do i even want to ask


[12/16/2022 7:44 PM] 5298_
We could start a fire through other means


[12/16/2022 7:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I doubt it would survive


[12/16/2022 7:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its winter and everything is frozen


[12/16/2022 7:45 PM] 5298_
I have a technique


[12/16/2022 7:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which means they have WATER CONTENT


[12/16/2022 7:47 PM] 5298_
Are there any other tools we should make aside a knife


[12/16/2022 7:47 PM] 5298_
A bow would be cool but impossible to bring home


[12/16/2022 7:47 PM] 5298_
We should try and find an area that's very hard for other people to find so we can try and keep the den


[12/16/2022 7:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[12/16/2022 7:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
FUCKING HELL


[12/16/2022 7:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/16/2022 8:03 PM] 5298_
I'm becoming more desensitized to animal death


[12/16/2022 8:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not


[12/16/2022 8:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But


[12/16/2022 8:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If i had to kill to survive i would


[12/16/2022 8:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wouldnt eat rats though even if i was starving cause theyre dirty little fuckers


[12/16/2022 8:04 PM] 5298_

I'm not entirely sure we can make the notch though


[12/16/2022 8:50 PM] 5298_
Set multiple alarms so you're ready for tomorrow

Mainly about the cold


[12/16/2022 11:27 PM] 5298_

[12/16/2022 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He said hell do an all nighter so he can be up early


[12/16/2022 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He said hes sick at making dens


[12/16/2022 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He said


[12/16/2022 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dont go how tun woods because he made a den there


[12/16/2022 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/16/2022 11:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

yellow warning for snow and ice tomorrow


[12/17/2022 5:21 PM] 5298_
We should wait for spring


[12/17/2022 5:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/17/2022 5:22 PM] 5298_
It's wet and cold and it's only going to get wetter and colder as Winter marches on, during the Easter holidays we can prepare, have full days of gathering materials, clearing land, making tools all ready to make the build


[12/17/2022 5:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im 9000% sure we are not getting fined 1 grand each btw


[12/17/2022 5:23 PM] 5298_
I know it's incredibly difficult but I want to make a digout, a small one deep in the woods


[12/17/2022 5:23 PM] 5298_
That's good


[12/17/2022 5:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"Trespassing on the railway is illegal and dangerous. You **could** be taken to court and face a ¬£1,000 fine.

For this reason, when we see someone trespassing, we have to stop all trains in the vicinity to remove trespassers, check for damage and clear blockages. This not only delays nearby trains, but also has a knock-on effect on trains across the network, sometimes lasting for hours."


[12/17/2022 5:24 PM] 5298_
With three men and enough time I think we can do it


[12/17/2022 5:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
YES


[12/17/2022 5:24 PM] 5298_
There were no trains anyways


[12/17/2022 5:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik


[12/17/2022 5:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I'm coughing like I have TB so let's definitely wait for warmer weeks

[12/17/2022 5:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
THEYRE SO FUCKING DUMB


[12/17/2022 5:30 PM] 5298_
The only thing with digouts is that you need to cut down trees which we definitely can't do


[12/17/2022 5:40 PM] 5298_
Private land is fucking retarded


[12/17/2022 5:41 PM] 5298_
Most private land is just empty fields


[12/17/2022 5:41 PM] 5298_
""Farmers"" buy it and never use it


[12/17/2022 5:41 PM] 5298_
When it could be turned into lush forest for wildlife and people to actually use instead of empty acres of grass


[12/17/2022 5:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik


[12/17/2022 5:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Stupid ass farmers


[12/17/2022 5:42 PM] 5298_
It pisses me off to no end


[12/17/2022 5:55 PM] 5298_
I want to leave


[12/17/2022 5:55 PM] 5298_
I want to just walk and see where I end up


[12/17/2022 6:04 PM] 5298_
Carrying with me only my clothes, some tools and knowledge of survival. Climbing mountains, traversing valleys, surviving off the land and whatever I can hunt as I move across the country, going where I please when I please. Only returning to civilization to get books. But because of the monster of capitalism wanted to gorge on our lives we can't do it. That's the only reason I want to move to America because there's so much more forest


[12/17/2022 6:05 PM] 5298_
It's so much easier to leave society in America than England


[12/17/2022 6:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just fed my silly little snake


[12/17/2022 8:15 PM] 5298_
I'm greatly upset, I don't like the idea of having many people and having multiple tribes l, I just wanted to make a little den in the forest and some tools and it's gotten greatly out of hand


[12/17/2022 8:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I agree but for some reason that is maxes idea and he isnt going to back down from it no matter what


[12/17/2022 8:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought he was just gonna build a den


[12/17/2022 8:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I do kinda like the idea of multiple little dens scattered around i just dont want loads of people


[12/17/2022 8:17 PM] 5298_
Let's tell him, hopefully both of us could persuade him


[12/17/2022 8:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We cant


[12/17/2022 8:18 PM] 5298_
I thought it was just going to be us two


[12/17/2022 8:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Trueful info


[12/17/2022 8:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dylan we should just go along with maxes multiple groups of our tribe spread out


[12/17/2022 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He has a completely separate bit of the forest, which means we should allow him to bring as many people as he wants but in such a case we would need messengers to get messages back and forth i reckon


[12/17/2022 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i like the idea of a fully functional society in the middle of a fucking tiny forest


[12/17/2022 8:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and also trade


[12/17/2022 8:32 PM] 5298_
As long as I don't have to deal with a large group I don't mind


[12/17/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Alright


[12/17/2022 8:32 PM] 5298_
If I'm in a group of 5+ people I get a panic attack


[12/17/2022 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It can just be me and you in the northern area


[12/17/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then his gang down south


[12/17/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill deal with business and shit


[12/17/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
for you


[12/17/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if you need me to pass a message along ill go to there area


[12/17/2022 8:33 PM] 5298_
Okay, thank you


[12/17/2022 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LETS FUCKING GO


[12/17/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im even more hyped now cause thisll be sick


[12/17/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should design a way for the "economy" to function


[12/17/2022 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Our own system


[12/17/2022 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also ik we dont know the area well but if theres enough space, we should have a trade route along the train lie

Me and max are making an economy system for trade if thats alright


[12/17/2022 8:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there will be currency involved, but we're trying not to have it too capitalismsitic


[12/17/2022 8:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel like capitalism would work here in its simplest form like inflation and stuff because it doesnt fuck anybody over


[12/17/2022 8:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We said we use bottle caps as currency


[12/17/2022 8:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Corks are the lowest value
Plastic caps are the middle ground
Metal Caps are the best


[12/17/2022 8:48 PM] 5298_
I can make us rich Rylan


[12/17/2022 8:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

We're rich Rylan


[12/17/2022 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Those are less valuable than corks


[12/17/2022 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
By metal caps he means the old ass ones


[12/17/2022 9:02 PM] 5298_

[12/17/2022 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[12/17/2022 9:02 PM] 5298_
Also shouldn't corks be more valuable because they're harder to get?


[12/17/2022 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
For some reason theyre not valuable


[12/17/2022 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because theyre SHIT


[12/17/2022 9:03 PM] 5298_
I've seen about 5 corks my whole life


[12/17/2022 9:04 PM] 5298_
I'm still going to collect the can caps because it's the only thing I have access to


[12/17/2022 9:04 PM] 5298_
In bulk at least


[12/17/2022 9:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can get a load of palstic caps


[12/17/2022 9:05 PM] 5298_
That's good


[12/17/2022 9:07 PM] 5298_
29 now


[12/17/2022 9:09 PM] 5298_
What's the metric?


[12/17/2022 9:09 PM] 5298_
Like, how many can caps is worth one cork and so on


[12/17/2022 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure


[12/17/2022 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'll figure that out


[12/17/2022 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but I found a metal one


[12/17/2022 9:12 PM] 5298_
That's great


[12/17/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Corks are now the most valuable bit of currency


[12/17/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Tabs
Plastic Lids
Metal Caps
Corks


[12/17/2022 9:13 PM] 5298_
That makes far more sense


[12/17/2022 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
max said they should be common because of reason which im not getting into


[12/17/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
10 tabs = 1 plastic lid
10 plastic lids = 1 metal cap
10 metal caps = 1 cork


[12/17/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats the currency value


[12/17/2022 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think we need currency inflation


[12/17/2022 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
actually


[12/17/2022 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IK you have capitalism


[12/17/2022 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but in this project it doesnt fuck anyone up the ass


[12/17/2022 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and we dont need exploit the environment


[12/17/2022 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We simply need inflation as a measure to stop chaos


[12/17/2022 9:15 PM] 5298_
So we have the equivalent of 3 lids and 9 tabs


[12/17/2022 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You have 26 tabs


[12/17/2022 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have 5 plastic lids

so far


[12/17/2022 9:16 PM] 5298_
I have 29


[12/17/2022 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and 1 metal cap


[12/17/2022 9:16 PM] 5298_
I found three more


[12/17/2022 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
26 tabs and 3 other thingys then?


[12/17/2022 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[12/17/2022 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
29 tabs, 5 plastic lids, 1 metal cap


[12/17/2022 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so


[12/17/2022 9:16 PM] 5298_
And Danielle had a collection for some reason so she's getting those for me


[12/17/2022 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
1.69 metal caps


[12/17/2022 9:17 PM] 5298_
0.1.7.9


[12/17/2022 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And then 0.169 tabs


[12/17/2022 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
TABSD?


[12/17/2022 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
corks


[12/17/2022 9:19 PM] 5298_
If I get 21 more tabs we will have 2 metal caps


[12/17/2022 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ong


[12/17/2022 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
7 plastic lids


[12/17/2022 9:23 PM] 5298_
So that's 2 metal caps, 4 plastic lids and 9 tabs


[12/17/2022 9:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lids are the ones on bottles in which an item meant for consumption through ingestion is stored


[12/17/2022 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
as soon as the weather clears up i think we should start work


[12/17/2022 9:29 PM] 5298_
February, mid February we will start work


[12/17/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So maybe towards the end of winter


[12/17/2022 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/17/2022 9:29 PM] 5298_
Yes, I don't want to freeze and it should be drier

From one source: "TRAPPIST-1g is the largest of the planets, with a radius 1.154 times that of Earth. The results, so far, indicate that it is unlikely to have a deep primordial hydrogen atmosphere. Larger gas and ice giants, like Jupiter or Neptune in our own solar system, tend to have such atmospheres. This means that TRAPPIST-1g could have a thinner, more terrestrial-type atmosphere, like that of Earth, Venus or Mars. If so, that would be good for the prospects of possible life, since those are secondary atmospheres, ones that have undergone significant chemical alterations over millions or billions of years. For example, Earth‚Äôs primarily nitrogen atmosphere is largely due to life processes changing it over time."


[12/18/2022 1:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I misinterpreted what they were saying


[12/18/2022 1:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There will also be updates about both TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1g given at the upcoming 241st Meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle, Washington (January 8-12, 2023).

From the abstract for TRAPPIST-1b:

In this talk, we present the first high-precision transit spectra of the warm Earth-sized planet TRAPPIST-1b based on two transit observations using NIRISS in SOSS mode on the James Webb Space Telescope. TRAPPIST-1b is the most favorable Earth-sized planet for characterization via transmission spectroscopy among all exoplanets. As such, our observations have the sensitivity to detect a wide range of atmospheres, providing unprecedented insight into the potentially secondary atmosphere on a rocky Earth-sized planet outside the solar system.

From the wiki


[12/21/2022 1:22 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It has been speculated that any hypothetical microorganisms inhabiting the atmosphere, if present, could employ ultraviolet light (UV) emitted by the Sun as an energy source, which could be an explanation for the dark lines (called "unknown UV absorber") observed in the UV photographs of Venus.[42][43] The existence of this "unknown UV absorber" prompted Carl Sagan to publish an article in 1963 proposing the hypothesis of microorganisms in the upper atmosphere as the agent absorbing the UV light.[44]

In August 2019, astronomers reported a newly discovered long-term pattern of UV light absorbance and albedo changes in the atmosphere of Venus and its weather, that is caused by "unknown absorbers" that may include unknown chemicals or even large colonies of microorganisms high up in the atmosphere.[45][46]

In January 2020, astronomers reported evidence that suggests Venus is currently (within 2.5 million years from present) volcanically active, and the residue from such activity may be a potential source of nutrients for possible microorganisms in the Venusian atmosphere.[47][48][49]

In 2021, it was suggested the color of "unknown UV absorber" match that of "red oil" - a known substance comprising a mix of organic carbon compounds dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid.

[12/24/2022 2:16 PM] 5298_
I don't think so


[12/24/2022 2:16 PM] 5298_
Because the pools are on the other side of the casam it's very unlikely they would get the soil wet enough to discolour it


[12/24/2022 2:17 PM] 5298_
If at all


[12/24/2022 2:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The water runs underground through that area


[12/24/2022 2:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the whole side of the chasma is water channels


[12/24/2022 2:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which then run through that area into the main pool

Unless that's a hotspot for the water channels I don't think so, because it's concentrated in that one area I think that it's a geological thing


[12/24/2022 2:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Most divots in mars have running water through them, just not on the ground


[12/24/2022 2:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/26/2022 1:29 PM] 5298_
We couldn't play monopoly because the dog would just eat the money and walk all over the board because she doesn't have a concise

[12/26/2022 8:42 PM] 5298_
I heard about people selling your data and couldn't believe I rejected it so much saying that "the government wouldn't do that why would they do that?" But now I realise, we aren't people to them, we're money and they will use us to our full potential


[12/26/2022 8:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I went through the same process


[12/26/2022 8:43 PM] 5298_
I've made a decision

Fuck the government, fuck the rules, I'm going to live how I want to, I know I'm not going to harm anyone so I'm going to live how I want even if it's illegal because some laws are just fucking stupid

I like the greek names


[12/26/2022 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and the roman names


[12/26/2022 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the both sound good but i prefer the greeks because it switches things up

fuck the name earth


[12/26/2022 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/26/2022 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Gaea


[12/26/2022 8:55 PM] 5298_
And I guess it stays true to the origins of the Gods because the Romans stole most of it


[12/26/2022 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/26/2022 8:56 PM] 5298_
I like that the three Kings of the Gods are the three most unique planets in a way


[12/26/2022 8:57 PM] 5298_
Urnaus - Coldest planet 
Saturn - Only planet with a ring 
Jupiter - Biggest planet


[12/26/2022 8:58 PM] 5298_
Within the solar system of course

[12/26/2022 9:01 PM] 5298_
Uranus was king of the Gods before his son, Saturn, usurped him and castrated him ( creating Venus ) then Saturn had a tyrannical reign, eating his children so they wouldn't usurp him but Gaia hid her new born son Jupiter in a cave and when he grew he usurped his father and became King of the Gods and freed his kin from the belly of Saturn


[12/26/2022 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So venus is just a giant penis


[12/26/2022 9:02 PM] 5298_
Yes


[12/26/2022 9:02 PM] 5298_
The sky penis turned into the most beautiful thing in all of creation on the sea bed and arrived on shore in a shell


[12/26/2022 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[12/26/2022 9:03 PM] 5298_
The Greeks were weird


[12/26/2022 9:07 PM] 5298_
Why have you changed Uranus to Boreas?


[12/26/2022 9:08 PM] 5298_
Boreas is the north wind


[12/26/2022 9:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Just did


[12/26/2022 9:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes ik


[12/26/2022 9:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the north wind brings cold


[12/26/2022 9:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Uranus is cold


[12/26/2022 9:08 PM] 5298_
Fair enough


[12/26/2022 9:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and I wanted it to sound different to Your anus


[12/26/2022 9:09 PM] 5298_
I wonder why Uranus is named after the Greek god and not named Caelus


[12/26/2022 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I could switch the names and have uranus named after caelus

People are getting colder and people don't know why but I have a theory


[12/26/2022 11:59 PM] 5298_
Global warming


[12/27/2022 12:00 AM] 5298_
Every new generation is about 0.003¬∞C colder than the last and I think it's because we don't need to be as warm because the global climate is getting cooler


[12/27/2022 12:01 AM] 5298_
It's the only thing that makes sense because it can't be anything to do with modern technology because non globalised tried in the Amazon are also suffering the same affect so it's something the whole world I being affected by i.e. climate change


[12/27/2022 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just searched it up and it says lower rates of infection are probably the best explanation


[12/27/2022 12:02 AM] 5298_
But unconnected tribes without modern medicine are also getting colder


[12/27/2022 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
how do we know that


[12/27/2022 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyre uncontacted


[12/27/2022 12:03 AM] 5298_
They're contacted but they're unconnected


[12/27/2022 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

typo


[12/27/2022 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
speak of the fucking devil


[12/27/2022 12:04 AM] 5298_
They're not like the Sentinelese where it's forbidden to go near them but they're still very much their own tribe without modern technology

[12/27/2022 2:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They'll be fucking awesome


[12/27/2022 2:18 AM] 5298_
I can


[12/27/2022 2:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Imagine knowing there's a mostly functioning human society on the fucking moon


[12/27/2022 2:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And mars

It's a shame they didn't keep going back to the moon


[12/27/2022 2:19 AM] 5298_
I would hate to wake up knowing there's another planet we've fucked up


[12/27/2022 2:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We can't fuck up an already fucked up planet


[12/27/2022 2:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The moon is a dead planet


[12/27/2022 2:20 AM] 5298_
We can give it a parasite


[12/27/2022 2:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You can't kill something that's dead


[12/27/2022 2:20 AM] 5298_
But you can fill it with maggots


[12/27/2022 2:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We can cover it in tardigrades


[12/27/2022 2:22 AM] 5298_
Until humans sort their shit out and figure out some semblance of peace we shouldn't move out to the stars


[12/27/2022 2:22 AM] 5298_
I think it would be unethical


[12/27/2022 2:23 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If we send everyone into space the view of earth has a psychological effect that causes a feeling of unity and shit don't know the name but it completely changes your mind


[12/27/2022 2:23 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The overview effect


[12/27/2022 2:24 AM] 5298_
But no one has lived with that view for years, a colony might reduce that effect like a drug, you have it so many times it stops working


[12/27/2022 2:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe we won't be such fools in the future


[12/27/2022 2:25 AM] 5298_
That's why I want to wait

Nicotine makes ‚âà$44 billion a year in the US alone, our generation was the first to see a massive decline in Nicotine addiction and then the vaping craze happened. Something to think about

Kennedy was definitely an inside job, Operation Northwoods was a proposed operation in which the US would commit acts of terrorism on themselves and use it as an excuse to invade Cuba, Kennedy rejected and was then assassinated


[12/27/2022 9:07 PM] 5298_
Does that hold any weight for 9/11 being an inside job, a little bit, does it mean I believe it was an inside job, not really


[12/27/2022 9:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I believe Kennedy was an inside job


[12/27/2022 9:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I knew about Operation Northwoods, and that made me very suspicious about 9/11


[12/27/2022 9:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because the circumstances were nearly identical to Operation Northwoods apart from the target


[12/27/2022 9:52 PM] 5298_
It would make sense as to why the towers were hit but the pentagon wasn't


[12/27/2022 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"hit"


[12/27/2022 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Apparently it was but the plane went under fucking ground


[12/27/2022 9:53 PM] 5298_
If you're Al-Qaida you're going to put the best kamikaze pilots onto hitting the fucking pentagon it makes no sense that it wasn't hit


[12/27/2022 9:53 PM] 5298_
I've seen the footage and it is quite suspicious


[12/27/2022 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mate the frame rate is so low


[12/27/2022 9:54 PM] 5298_
The plane goes into the tower and then like 1.5 seconds later it blows up, it doesn't look real


[12/27/2022 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theres no plane


[12/27/2022 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

And remember kids


[12/31/2022 1:38 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Next time someone tells you the government wouldn't do that


[12/31/2022 1:38 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh yes they would


[12/31/2022 1:38 AM] 5298_
So you've seen them too


[12/31/2022 1:38 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wendigoon


[12/31/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm gonna watch some more of his conspiracy videos soon


[12/31/2022 1:39 AM] 5298_
I've forgotten which video it's from


[12/31/2022 1:39 AM] 5298_
Same


[12/31/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The video he made on the garden  of Eden from Satan's perspective was interesting


[12/31/2022 1:39 AM] 5298_
I'm becoming more of a conspiracy theorists


[12/31/2022 1:39 AM] 5298_
The Paradise Lost video?


[12/31/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The bible would make for a great fantasy book if it weren't religious


[12/31/2022 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/31/2022 1:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like swear down


[12/31/2022 1:40 AM] 5298_
Yeah, that's how I found him and I love that video


[12/31/2022 1:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/31/2022 1:40 AM] 5298_
I love his religious stuff because even though I don't like religion it's still heart warming to see him get emotional about it, it's usually about Eden


[12/31/2022 1:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh my g≈ì√∏d no w√†¬™√£y

[12/31/2022 1:43 AM] 5298_
I think it's because you're a pedophile


[12/31/2022 1:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] 5298_
See, you're a pedophile


[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Could mean Ronald Reagan


[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or


[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] 5298_
Rylan O'Neill


[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ronald McDonald


[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or Riley Sinclair


[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Which matches perfectly with what he does


[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] 5298_
Riley Sinclair is a freak


[12/31/2022 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He chats up every girl in our class


[12/31/2022 1:45 AM] 5298_
He sent someone I know a rape threat, I can't talk about who though


[12/31/2022 1:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We went through his messages was and he was guilt tripping then by saying he was gonna kill himself


[12/31/2022 1:45 AM] 5298_
Freak


[12/31/2022 1:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He's so weird he acts hard over text or in an xbox party but irl he's quiet as fuck


[12/31/2022 1:46 AM] 5298_
Fucking look at him, I think I could beat the shit out of him and I weigh as much as a 9 year old


[12/31/2022 1:46 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What the fucking hell wendigoons conspiracy iceberg is 9 hours long


[12/31/2022 1:47 AM] 5298_
It's a collection of multiple videos from across months


[12/31/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ah


[12/31/2022 1:47 AM] 5298_
The first like 4 hours are shit quality


[12/31/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'll pick it up where i left off


[12/31/2022 1:47 AM] 5298_
So I didn't watch it because it made me want to cut my ears off


[12/31/2022 1:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I fell asleep so I can't pin point it tho


[12/31/2022 1:48 AM] 5298_
Have you seen his newest video?


[12/31/2022 1:49 AM] 5298_
It's very intriguing but not for the reason he meant


[12/31/2022 1:50 AM] 5298_
It's another Missing 411


[12/31/2022 1:51 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No it popped up before tho


[12/31/2022 1:51 AM] 5298_
He's claiming Bigfoot exists or some variation of it


[12/31/2022 1:52 AM] 5298_
The Tennessee Wildman


[12/31/2022 1:52 AM] 5298_
But I just think it's an interesting case


[12/31/2022 1:52 AM] 5298_
It's curious how the boy disappeared suddenly


[12/31/2022 1:53 AM] 5298_
And why the Rangers covered up their investigations but I don't think it's the Tennessee Wildman


[12/31/2022 1:53 AM] 5298_
If it was we would have found one by now


[12/31/2022 1:54 AM] 5298_
A skeleton at least


[12/31/2022 1:54 AM] 5298_
Although America has hidden larger things


[12/31/2022 1:55 AM] 5298_
Well, maybe not as large as a species of kidnapping ape-men but still pretty large


[12/31/2022 1:55 AM] 5298_
Like the Manhattan Project for example


[12/31/2022 2:01 AM] 5298_
MKUltra, Project Bluebird, Project Artichoke, Operation Condor


[12/31/2022 2:05 AM] 5298_
America is awful


[12/31/2022 2:05 AM] 5298_
I can't think of anywhere worse


[12/31/2022 2:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I saw some guy on tiktok who was showing something


[12/31/2022 2:06 AM] 5298_
There are places that have done worse things but either their awful deeds are talked about or people already know the country is evil, America is the worst because everyone thinks it's the greatest place but it's full of human rights violations


[12/31/2022 2:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Then a cia officer told him not to investigate


[12/31/2022 2:07 AM] 5298_
Let me guess


[12/31/2022 2:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Then he made a video saying that it was all fake before mysteriously dying a few days later


[12/31/2022 2:07 AM] 5298_
The guy killed himself


[12/31/2022 2:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not sure


[12/31/2022 2:07 AM] 5298_
The CIA have admitted that they have weapons to make it look like people died naturally or killed themselves

[12/31/2022 2:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
His last video


[12/31/2022 2:08 AM] 5298_
Remember the heart attack gun


[12/31/2022 2:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/31/2022 2:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The thumbnail to thst was I am scared

[12/31/2022 2:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What the fuck was he looking at in that "it was all fake video"


[12/31/2022 2:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He looks tired and shit


[12/31/2022 2:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Then he warily looks to his left


[12/31/2022 2:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Pauses what he is saying and stutters


[12/31/2022 2:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Looks at camera


[12/31/2022 2:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Looks again warily to his left


[12/31/2022 2:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Then continues on


[12/31/2022 2:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's so fucking strange


[12/31/2022 2:12 AM] 5298_
That man found something he shouldn't have, and the CIA killed him


[12/31/2022 2:12 AM] 5298_
I'm convinced just from those videos


[12/31/2022 2:12 AM] 5298_
What did he find


[12/31/2022 2:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Sounds fucking crazy but he was recording what seems to be ufos


[12/31/2022 2:13 AM] 5298_
I've just looked it up, it's giants apparently


[12/31/2022 2:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And giants


[12/31/2022 2:15 AM] 5298_
Either this man found fucking aliens or he's using a CIA scare for something, maybe to add validity to his claims or for attention of some kind but it doesn't seem likely


[12/31/2022 2:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/31/2022 2:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The way he looks in that I am lying video looks like he's serious


[12/31/2022 2:16 AM] 5298_
It's the disappearance that makes me believe he isn't lying, or at least not for attention


[12/31/2022 2:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He got a video of the agent telling him to turn around


[12/31/2022 2:17 AM] 5298_
Maybe he wanted to disappear, I mean I do and maybe this was his way of doing it, he knows everyone knows the CIA kills people when it suits them so he uses a major conspiracy theory, fakes CIA involvement and goes to where ever he pleases and starts a new life


[12/31/2022 2:18 AM] 5298_
I'm just trying to think of other explanations than aliens


[12/31/2022 2:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Honestly sounds plausible


[12/31/2022 2:19 AM] 5298_
Because I think America _might_ be able to hide the Tennessee Wildman but not fucking Aliens, you cants hide Aliens


[12/31/2022 2:19 AM] 5298_
They have UFO's so they'd be spotted everywhere


[12/31/2022 2:19 AM] 5298_
Not just America, so they can't contain them


[12/31/2022 2:21 AM] 5298_
I believe the CIA kills people that catch on to them or pose a threat to them, like JFK, but I don't think they're hiding fucking aliens, it's would be impossible


[12/31/2022 2:22 AM] 5298_
There would be sittings across the globe and the US can't dispose of that many people in that many countries


[12/31/2022 2:24 AM] 5298_
Aliens exist, of that I'm sure but I don't think they've made contact and if they have they have their hiding off their own volition, the US isn't hiding them


[12/31/2022 2:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[12/31/2022 2:26 AM] 5298_
If the universe is infinite there has to be more life out there


[12/31/2022 2:26 AM] 5298_
It can't be an infinite amount of planets but only 6 million species, it can't


[12/31/2022 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We in for a shit year


[12/31/2022 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/31/2022 9:48 PM] 5298_
I don't like the Rothschild conspiracy because it's just devolved into anti-Semitism


[12/31/2022 9:48 PM] 5298_
"look at these greedy Jews ruining the world"


[12/31/2022 9:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[12/31/2022 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why are like 99% of deaths in my family in September-October


[01/01/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Normally when its new year the date looks wrong but the date looks fucking fine to me today


[01/01/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/01/2023 12:55 AM] 5298_
Happy new year


[01/01/2023 1:04 AM] 5298_

[01/01/2023 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Whenever its new years day


[01/01/2023 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/01/2023 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the year looks wrong


[01/01/2023 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like 2018 > 2019


[01/01/2023 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
looked really fucking strange


[01/01/2023 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But for me


[01/01/2023 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
this year 2023 looks like it was always there, familiar


[01/01/2023 1:05 AM] 5298_
2 and 3 look similar where as 8 and 9 don't so that might be it


[01/01/2023 1:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was thinking that


[01/01/2023 1:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And on top of that, ive been thinking about and seeing the number 2023


[01/01/2023 1:06 AM] 5298_
23 enigma, you'll be used to seeing 23


[01/01/2023 1:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[01/01/2023 1:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive only just realised in the last few days how common 23 is


[01/01/2023 1:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my dad was 23 when i was born


[01/01/2023 1:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/01/2023 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My great grandma gave birth to my grandpa at 23


[01/01/2023 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My nana was 23 when she gave birth to my dad


[01/01/2023 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/01/2023 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

ive been on a walk


[01/01/2023 2:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
on a winters day


[01/01/2023 2:29 AM] 5298_
California Dreaming has become synonymous with conspiracy and racism


[01/01/2023 2:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/01/2023 2:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its a good fucking song tho


[01/01/2023 2:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its just shit its been turned into like a ted kazcsaksjfidjyingy anthem


[01/01/2023 2:30 AM] 5298_
There's so much Rothschild conspiracy where that song plays and it's mostly racist


[01/01/2023 2:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/01/2023 2:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The conspiracy theory itself makes a lot of sense in my own eyes but the way people twist into something against jews is a bit retarded


[01/01/2023 2:32 AM] 5298_
The anti-Semitism is retarded but I do like that it's making people hate capitalism


[01/01/2023 2:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/01/2023 2:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont hate capitalism i just hate the path that humans are taking


[01/01/2023 2:33 AM] 5298_
But the people that think the Rothschild's orchestrated the American Civil War to keep the federal bank and it had nothing to do with slavery are retarded


[01/01/2023 2:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/01/2023 2:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Honestly


[01/01/2023 2:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If world peace could ever be achieved


[01/01/2023 2:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which it wont


[01/01/2023 2:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
imagine what we could do


[01/01/2023 2:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The future is dull to me


[01/01/2023 2:33 AM] 5298_
I had an epiphany the other night


[01/01/2023 2:34 AM] 5298_
Utopia has to be anarchist


[01/01/2023 2:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What would that be


[01/01/2023 2:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[01/01/2023 2:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Whys that


[01/01/2023 2:34 AM] 5298_
Because the idea of laws aren't utopian


[01/01/2023 2:34 AM] 5298_
Prisons aren't utopian so laws aren't either


[01/01/2023 2:34 AM] 5298_
Punishment isn't utopian


[01/01/2023 2:35 AM] 5298_
You need anarchism to have a utopia


[01/01/2023 2:35 AM] 5298_
World peace and utopia are different though


[01/01/2023 2:35 AM] 5298_
World peace could be totalitarian


[01/01/2023 2:36 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I fucking hate this planet man


[01/01/2023 2:37 AM] 5298_
If the whole world is under one governmental body then there would be no wars, and if everyone was under surveillance with threat of death if any act of violence is taken then the whole world would be non violent and peaceful but it's dystopian and unethical


[01/01/2023 2:38 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just want to be rid of this evil fucking world


[01/01/2023 2:38 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And the world I'm talking about isn't Earth, it's the Human race


[01/01/2023 2:38 AM] 5298_
I wouldn't mind being dead but I don't want to die


[01/01/2023 2:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's unfair as shit


[01/01/2023 2:40 AM] 5298_
The act of dying seems painful and I don't want it but death seems alright, better than becoming part of the capitalist regime, hardly being able to sustain myself in a job I hate with people I hate and paying taxes to a government I hate full of cunts I hate in a country I hate


[01/01/2023 2:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its not being dead that scares me its the way ill die


[01/01/2023 2:41 AM] 5298_
I wish I was a ghost


[01/01/2023 2:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/01/2023 2:41 AM] 5298_
It seems so cool


[01/01/2023 2:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Get to talk to my dead relatives


[01/01/2023 2:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I always wonder


[01/01/2023 2:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Do Ghosts speak the language(s) that they spoke die or is there just telepathic communication in a universal mind language


[01/01/2023 2:42 AM] 5298_
No one can touch you, no one can see you and you can just watch, I like observing things, animals, situations, people, anything but I never get to because I'll get shouted at for staring at people


[01/01/2023 2:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wonder if as a ghost you can visit anywhere you want in the universe


[01/01/2023 2:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wonder if as a ghost you are given knowledge of everything


[01/01/2023 2:43 AM] 5298_
I get terrified of it when I'm in public, I can't look at anyone because I'm scared they'll think I'm staring at complain for harassment


[01/01/2023 2:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate making eye contact with people im not mates wit


[01/01/2023 2:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
with


[01/01/2023 2:44 AM] 5298_
It seems to me they could but it would take a while, using the conventional idea of a ghost they could probably fly to anywhere but it would take a while


[01/01/2023 2:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Well a ghost presumably has no mass so id guess you could fly at the speed of light


[01/01/2023 2:45 AM] 5298_
That would make sense scientifically


[01/01/2023 2:45 AM] 5298_
But ghosts come from the idea of a soul and a soul had weight


[01/01/2023 2:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
People think that a soul weights 20g because thats the weight you lose immediately upon dying


[01/01/2023 2:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
weighs*


[01/01/2023 2:46 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But how can energy weigh anything


[01/01/2023 2:46 AM] 5298_
So you could still fly fast but not the speed of light


[01/01/2023 2:46 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think im going insane


[01/01/2023 2:46 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think im real


[01/01/2023 2:46 AM] 5298_
I'm pretty sure you are


[01/01/2023 2:46 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How can we be so certain


[01/01/2023 2:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We don't even know how our mind works


[01/01/2023 2:47 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Everything is just too fucking interconnected why is everything a coincidence


[01/01/2023 2:47 AM] 5298_
The Hard Problem of Consciousness keeps me up at night


[01/01/2023 2:48 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How do chemicals just arrange in such a way it creates a being able to think


[01/01/2023 2:49 AM] 5298_
I hate the prospect of matter being conscious naturally and it has nothing to do with brains or anything and we're just able to talk


[01/01/2023 2:49 AM] 5298_
So trees could be conscious, or your bed or walls or pc or anything


[01/01/2023 2:49 AM] 5298_
It's terrifying


[01/01/2023 2:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/01/2023 2:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A cpu is a rock we tricked into thinking by electrocuting it


[01/01/2023 2:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How do we know AIs arent conscious


[01/01/2023 2:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Specially Chat AIs


[01/01/2023 2:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or any ai actually


[01/01/2023 2:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They learn


[01/01/2023 2:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is a sign of intelligence


[01/01/2023 2:52 AM] 5298_
I just don't like the prospect that my walls are conscious


[01/01/2023 2:52 AM] 5298_
If my whole bedroom is full of conscious things that means at night I'm being watched by so many things


[01/01/2023 2:53 AM] 5298_
Well


[01/01/2023 2:53 AM] 5298_
No


[01/01/2023 2:53 AM] 5298_
They don't have eyes


[01/01/2023 2:53 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont like the prospect of the subconscious


[01/01/2023 2:53 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The fact theres a locked part of me i cant access in terms of thoughts is scary]


[01/01/2023 2:54 AM] 5298_
That's why I will never drink or do drugs


[01/01/2023 2:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im gonna go now


[01/01/2023 2:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe the answer to everything will come to me in a dream


[01/01/2023 2:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I only hope


[01/01/2023 2:54 AM] 5298_
Okay Mr. O'Neill.


[01/01/2023 2:54 AM] 5298_
Goodnight and happy new year


[01/01/2023 2:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wait


[01/01/2023 2:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
one last thing


[01/01/2023 2:55 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
visitation dreams


[01/01/2023 2:55 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what do you think about them


[01/01/2023 2:56 AM] 5298_
The brain's unconscious response to the trauma of losing a loved one using the already attained knowledge of the loved one and the conventional idea of a ghost or spirit


[01/01/2023 2:56 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good idea


[01/01/2023 2:56 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had one not long ago it was strange


[01/01/2023 2:57 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Beforehand I was at a caravan site then i attacked someone ran up these stairs fell over then suddenly i was at a funeral and my dead relative walked in looking nervous as fuck and i hugged them and i think i asked if they were okay


[01/01/2023 2:58 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Very strange


[01/01/2023 2:59 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If there really is an afterlife and that was them truly visiting me then im glad theyre okay


[01/01/2023 3:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Well im gonna go for real


[01/01/2023 3:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/01/2023 3:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/01/2023 6:25 PM] 5298_
Someone has hacked into my laptop and is monitoring me


[01/01/2023 6:25 PM] 5298_
I can hear them


[01/01/2023 6:26 PM] 5298_
I hear the static in my headphones and my camera light turns on randomly


[01/01/2023 6:26 PM] 5298_
Even when my laptop is off


[01/01/2023 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao wtf


[01/01/2023 6:28 PM] 5298_
The FBI are onto me

[01/01/2023 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
who got onto laptop through malware


[01/01/2023 6:29 PM] 5298_
It's because I know they killed JFK, MLK and did 9/11


[01/01/2023 6:29 PM] 5298_
It's been like this for over a year


[01/01/2023 6:29 PM] 5298_
That is one dedicated pedophile


[01/01/2023 6:40 PM] 5298_
I thought I had electrical tape but I don't, I was going to tape over my camera


[01/01/2023 6:40 PM] 5298_
I still have that gaffer tape


[01/01/2023 6:45 PM] 5298_
I don't know about you but that doesn't look like New York

[01/01/2023 11:43 PM] 5298_
Al-Qaida takes credit for their terrorism

Me and a friend have written a story by taking turns each sentence. Would you like to read it?


[01/02/2023 2:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
SURE


[01/02/2023 2:26 AM] 5298_
1) Ursa Major was shining bright in the sky, the lazy bear stalked through the abyss as though it was making its way to a great feast of hunny off the horizon line and there so too shall we be, everything is ready as we board the ship to set sail to the horizon.
2) The water gently moved in the wind, almost in a welcoming way, and the reflections of the stars swam with it
3) The vessel rocked gently with the water, the quiet whispering of the waves against the hull was the only sound in the empty port.
4) watching as we say goodbye to what we know, we'll see you again one day, but the sea is calling, it's time to go
5) We sail south, heading into the sea ready to make our journey when the wind picks up, mumbling its curses into our sails and making the water chew at the hull.
6) it felt as though it was telling us to leave, but we couldn't, we were called by the waves and welcomed by the sea, it would be rude to leave now.
7) Our defiance of the winds call must have angered Boreas himself because the north wind then blew with a great ire, paining the mast and making the sea crash viciously
8) we thought the sea was our friend, but it turned on us so suddenly, what we thought we could trust now betraying us
9) The wind grew violent, straining the sails to their limit when the vessel began to lift, her bow lifting into the air before we arose out of the ocean, as though crashing on a rock but all that was under us was the air.
10) we moved on, growing higher by the second, looking down to see everything become smaller, something that is so large, now comparable to a seed
11) I felt sick as I leaned over the deck, seeing the Mediterranean fleeing away from us, Iberia in sight now as we flew up to Uranus; his great mass blanketing the world, I wondered if Zeus would paint our peculiar voyage in the same sky we sailed to.
12) from sailing the sea to sailing the sky, the view had definitely changed, from the place we knew so well to a place like a stranger to us


[01/02/2023 2:26 AM] 5298_
13) We sailed Hera's stain now, the immaculate bright dots that formed the depictions of the great legends grew larger and I couldn't help but think of Icarus and his hubris, would the same fate befall us?


[01/02/2023 2:26 AM] 5298_
That's it all

There's an artist I really like and I want to be the number one listener for Spotify Wrapped next year

I don't understand why impartial history is so important to people


[01/02/2023 8:59 PM] 5298_
History should be a way to learn about the mistakes from the past to pave a better future, it should be biased


[01/02/2023 8:59 PM] 5298_
Every history lesson about slavery should paint it as evil


[01/02/2023 9:01 PM] 5298_
Same with WWII, Imperialism, Native American genocide


[01/02/2023 9:01 PM] 5298_

Because Bernards is hell


[01/02/2023 11:30 PM] 5298_
The staff are incompetent, the punishments are pathetic and the students are plucked out of hell


[01/02/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[01/02/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
also the term dates are stupid


[01/02/2023 11:31 PM] 5298_
The only reason I don't want to move is because I won't have the support I have at Bernards in a new school, at least not for a while and it would make things harder on my grandad


[01/02/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we always break up a day later and go back a day earlier


[01/02/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to move school and i can at any time but i would like to see my friends


[01/02/2023 11:32 PM] 5298_
You're literally my only friend and I can message you and see you outside of school so that's not an issue for me


[01/02/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Damn


[01/02/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
If I got confirmation on my autism I would move in a heart beat because it would mean I could get support in a new school

True goes for all my mates to be honest


[01/02/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/02/2023 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was like 300000000000000000000000000 gigabytes


[01/02/2023 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i cant remember


[01/02/2023 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
think it was 3 million gigabytes


[01/02/2023 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wait


[01/02/2023 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/02/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
3 million yottabytes


[01/02/2023 11:41 PM] 5298_
Blow up St. Bernards by using zip bombs so big the pc's overheat and explode


[01/02/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
55.4 YOTTABYTES


[01/02/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
NOT 3 MILLION


[01/02/2023 11:43 PM] 5298_
3 milion Yottabytes is enough storage to probably document literally anything that could ever be written in image files where each image is one letter to what could be written


[01/02/2023 11:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was 55.4 yottabytes


[01/02/2023 11:43 PM] 5298_
That's still insane


[01/02/2023 11:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant get it back anymore


[01/02/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I sent it to you i think and told you about it


[01/02/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nvm


[01/02/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i had a 3 yottabyte zip bomb


[01/02/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fuck man


[01/02/2023 11:45 PM] 5298_
Luckily I didn't click it


[01/02/2023 11:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I didnt send it


[01/02/2023 11:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cause you said


[01/02/2023 11:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
NO


[01/02/2023 11:45 PM] 5298_
I remember you sending me a zip bomb and I nearly clicked it


[01/02/2023 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It isnt a bomb


[01/02/2023 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
until extracted


[01/02/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
Or something to do with a zip bomb


[01/02/2023 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so if you had it installed it would only explode if you extracted it


[01/02/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
Zip bomb Sunak


[01/02/2023 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I got the bomb

i might as well just suffer for the rest of my life than wait another 3 years for something that may happen


[01/02/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
It takes three months to get diagnosed if you're referred so if I got referred now it would almost be the summer holidays by the time I get diagnosed


[01/02/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
It would be April, so 2 months away from summer holidays


[01/02/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
Or is it three, I always forget

I want to get a test but I'm afraid to ask for some reason


[01/02/2023 11:53 PM] 5298_
It's because there's genetic components and I would feel like I'm saying my family has autism


[01/02/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/02/2023 11:53 PM] 5298_
Although they definitely do


[01/02/2023 11:53 PM] 5298_
But I think my dad and grandad would take offence if I called them autistic


[01/02/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im so fucking funny on xbox


[01/02/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know how to get peoples ips


[01/02/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I always do it with my other mates


[01/02/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its dead fucking funny


[01/02/2023 11:54 PM] 5298_
If I knew how to get people's ips I would be a menace


[01/02/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i do all the ip pulling then my mate starts asking if he can sleep over at their house wherever they live


[01/02/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can get someones now


[01/02/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If theyre playing a supported game


[01/02/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont even have to join them


[01/02/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
If I could do ip tracking I would get my friend to send me the discord of the nonces that message her and I would just DM them their ip


[01/02/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
How threatening would it be if someone you don't know just randomly dm'd you your IP adress


[01/02/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/02/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have a way


[01/02/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you have to get them to trust your mate


[01/02/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i will make a link, it might be obvious that its an ip logger to them, but if theyre stupid theyll click it without thinking


[01/02/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i get their ip


[01/02/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and ill send it to you


[01/02/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and you can convert that to location


[01/02/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
location isnt always accurate


[01/02/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sometimes its accurate down to the county, sometimes to the town and sometimes to the country


[01/02/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We managed to get one accurate to the town yesterday


[01/02/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
some kid lived in a town in nebraska and he started shitting his pants


[01/02/2023 11:59 PM] 5298_

[01/02/2023 11:59 PM] 5298_
It would be terrifying


[01/03/2023 12:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/03/2023 7:16 PM] 5298_
"Many people feared Irish immigrants. There had been terrorist attacks from Irish nationalists known as Fenians. They wanted independence from Britain. In 1893 the Metropolitan Police created special branch of police to deal with this kind of threat - it was called the 'Special Branch'!"

It's usually used as evidence of terrorism but owning it is not illegal

10 metal caps = 1 cork


[01/07/2023 5:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
0.164 corks


[01/07/2023 5:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I might buy a fucking bag of corks


[01/07/2023 5:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have the money to buy about 100 bags of corks


[01/07/2023 5:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
25x100=2500 corks


[01/07/2023 5:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/07/2023 5:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/07/2023 5:45 PM] 5298_

[01/07/2023 5:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its a currency


[01/07/2023 5:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it can be used to buy things

I'm having a philosophical crisis


[01/07/2023 6:36 PM] 5298_
My Scientific nature and love for objective truth is clashing with my want for stoicism and hedonism. My morals also clash with the idea, my moral compass points to changing the world for the better and trying to help people selflessly but I also want to live a hedonic life where I live to live, I believe that in the absurdist philosophy of the universe in that there ultimately isn't a meaning but I whole-heartedly want to shed that philosophy and live a life of hedonism and stoicism where I better myself for happiness but I can't do that while trying to change the world for the better. My wants repel each other and I'm torn between selflessness and hedonism

[01/08/2023 7:22 PM] 5298_

[01/08/2023 7:30 PM] 5298_
I'm keeping tally of mine and when It's Easter and we can actually go to Sowerby without being ill for a week afterwards we can add everything up


[01/08/2023 7:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[01/08/2023 7:51 PM] 5298_
Do you think if we never mention the currency that they might forget and we can be the richest


[01/08/2023 8:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dont think so


[01/08/2023 8:23 PM] 5298_
Well if they forget to collect stuff and we keep collection we could get more


[01/08/2023 8:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We got cole selby with us so i tryna get him to collect them as well


[01/08/2023 8:25 PM] 5298_
What does a metal cap have to be? Does it specifically have to be like a glass bottle cap or just a metal lid


[01/08/2023 8:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probably glass bottle cap


[01/08/2023 8:25 PM] 5298_
Because Dutton's sells a drink with a metal lid


[01/08/2023 8:25 PM] 5298_
But I don't think it's a bottle cap


[01/08/2023 8:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What is it for


[01/08/2023 8:26 PM] 5298_
I don't know, Danielle told me about it


[01/08/2023 8:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh


[01/08/2023 9:19 PM] 5298_
I've had a realisation


[01/08/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
We can do what ever the fuck we want


[01/08/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
If you reject fear you can do nearly anything


[01/08/2023 9:23 PM] 5298_
Fear commands us, every opportunity I've never taken was because of fear. Fear of punishment or disappointing someone or being bullied but if I reject that fear I can live my life how I want to live it and can be happier


[01/08/2023 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats what i think but i still fear like everything


[01/08/2023 10:00 PM] 5298_
Same, I'm trying to get better at it though


[01/08/2023 10:03 PM] 5298_
There are certain things that I'm terrified of and I don't think it would be beneficial to not be afraid of them but everything else I'm trying to become less afraid of


[01/08/2023 10:08 PM] 5298_
There are always secrets best kept hidden, at least for the time being


[01/08/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
I'm looking at the census map and I've noticed something


[01/08/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_
It's mainly the richer areas of Barrow that have a higher trans population, places like Ormsgill and Hawcoat have less that 0.4% trans people but Barrow and Salthouse both have over 0.5%


[01/08/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not surprising


[01/08/2023 10:22 PM] 5298_
How so?


[01/08/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's normally the poorer areas which have conservative values but a preference towards a socialist economy


[01/08/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm not exactly sure why, but it's probably to do with the fact they have more important things to worry about than lgbt


[01/08/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
But the map you sent me of who voted what I'm Barrow, the areas that voted Tory have a larger trans population than that that voted labour


[01/08/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
I see a lot more accepting people come from those areas and a lot more bigoted people come from places like Ormsgill so that might be why


[01/08/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The richer areas vote for the tories because the tories favour them economically


[01/08/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The richer areas are the opposite of poor areas


[01/08/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wait dylan where did you get that map from


[01/08/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it actually seems ormsgill is gayer than the richer aeras


[01/08/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
Ons.gov.uk


[01/08/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Poorer areas have higher lgbt rates than the richer areas it seems


[01/08/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
1.50% in ormsgill


[01/08/2023 10:27 PM] 5298_
Ormsgill has a 3% LGB community but there's a specific transgender section


[01/08/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[01/08/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

O.35% of people aged 16 years and over in Ormsgill & Hindpool have a gender identity different from their sex registered at birth


[01/08/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I would like to see different ages instead of everyone over 16 being clumped together


[01/08/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I believe theres way higher rates of LGBT in younger people


[01/08/2023 10:31 PM] 5298_
Same, it would make the numbers much more interesting because the older generations are less likely to be LGBT+ so you could see a more accurate rate of LGBT+ people if you look specifically at Gen Z and Millennials because they're less likely to have LGBT+ thoughts and feeling beaten from them


[01/08/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I saw something on tiktok the other day that makes sense to me


[01/08/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
People who have a trans identity and force you to use the pronouns they use are probably doing it as a way of gaining acceptance and support


[01/08/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
I don't understand


[01/08/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
FUCK


[01/08/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IT WAS THERE


[01/08/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I lost it man


[01/08/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But it makes sense the way it was explained


[01/08/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i also have forgotten how to word it


[01/08/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think its more to do with neopronouns tho


[01/08/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and non binary


[01/08/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I worded it wrong


[01/08/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its not transgender people


[01/08/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
as a whole


[01/08/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its non binary people and people who use neo pronouns specifically


[01/08/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
I think that people who are trans ask people use their preferred pronouns as a way of feeling accepted and validated and to decrease their gender dysphoria


[01/08/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[01/08/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
Neo pronouns are bullshit so they can fuck off but non binary makes sense to me


[01/08/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Non binary doesnt and does make sense to me


[01/08/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_
How so?


[01/08/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It just confuses me


[01/08/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like I just don't understand how you can not identify as a gender


[01/08/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also genderfluid people should piss off you shouldnt be able to change gender like every week


[01/08/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
It seems to me that gender and sexuality aren't as black and white as people think. It isn't that if you aren't a boy you're a girl or if you aren't straight you're gay, there can be other ones in-between and from my understanding non binary is the asexuality of gender, asexual people aren't straight or gay because they feel no sexual attraction and non binary people aren't boy or girl because they feel no connection to gender


[01/08/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know that it's just that i cant understand it


[01/08/2023 10:41 PM] 5298_
I guess such foreign concepts can't be understood by people who don't identify with it. I don't fully understand it


[01/08/2023 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was thinking that


[01/08/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can understand asexuality


[01/08/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But I cant non binary


[01/08/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to do an experiment


[01/08/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to have 3 classrooms with the same amount of students:
One is taught like we are nowadays with some sort of lgbt acceptance like we do in pshe
One is taught nothing about sexuality or gender
One is taught that lgbt is bad and so on


[01/08/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The results are nearly self explanatory


[01/08/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But the one that is taught nothing would be interesting


[01/08/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
See how many people identify as lgbt


[01/08/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/08/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wonder if they're taught nothing, will they identify as their biological sex and straight or will they be lgbt and/or identify as non binary


[01/08/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its interesting


[01/08/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
I think you would be a wide variety


[01/08/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
The class that's taught about it would have a slightly higher LGBT population than the class that's not taught anything but the class that's taught it's evil will have none or like 2 at the most


[01/08/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/08/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the class that is taught its evil and the class that is taught its good are only there as like indicators


[01/08/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
What I would like to know is the ratio of trans people to LGB+ people in the class that's not taught anything


[01/08/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/08/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i feel like theres a small part of lgbt that are actually lgbt and a huge majority is just that way because a celebrity is


[01/08/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like the ones on tiktok and that


[01/08/2023 10:49 PM] 5298_
I think it's the other way around


[01/08/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont blame you


[01/08/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it could be


[01/08/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
If we're using 16+ as our sample I think the majority will be LGBT+ and the minority will be because of celebrities but the -16 sample will be the other way around


[01/08/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The majority of 16+ people who are lgbt is quite broad


[01/08/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Id say it should be under <23 because that is around the point that mental maturity is reached and i feel like that might have an effect on everything


[01/08/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
What are your views on transgender people?


[01/08/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It depends


[01/08/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If they're using neopronouns and shit they are probably faking it unless they have a mental disability


[01/08/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But theyre good people


[01/08/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theres obviously bad apples but you can say that for every group


[01/08/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
What's about the ""traditional"" transgender people like MTF and FTM


[01/08/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They're just like everyone else


[01/08/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Non binary people are just like everyone else


[01/08/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I believe the people who get transition surgery cement the title of transgender though


[01/08/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
I just feel sorry for them


[01/08/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My whole view is though


[01/08/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We need to see eachother as a group instead of who and what we are


[01/08/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It shouldnt matter to anyone that youre a different race or gender or sexuality etc


[01/08/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
It's no secret that I'm not overly fond of my appearance but imagine your entire body being afront to who you are and the only way to solve it is to have surgery and take hormones for the rest of your life


[01/08/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
It must be an awful existence


[01/08/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But I feel like this is being taken out of context and is being weaponised by people to be racist to white people, and straight people


[01/08/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it sounds stupid


[01/08/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i see so many tiktoks of people saying that all white people should die and straight people and what not


[01/08/2023 11:02 PM] 5298_
Yeah that's just retarded


[01/08/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theyre like


[01/08/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
right wing


[01/08/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but not right wing


[01/08/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyre doing exactly what fascists do


[01/08/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but in a left wing fashion


[01/08/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My thoughts are you should be seen for who you are and not what you are


[01/08/2023 11:05 PM] 5298_
It's as if politics is a circle and they've gone so far left they've become far right


[01/08/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/08/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wonder if that point exists too on the right wing


[01/08/2023 11:07 PM] 5298_
It does


[01/08/2023 11:07 PM] 5298_
Nazism


[01/08/2023 11:07 PM] 5298_
National Socialism


[01/08/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nazism and national socialism are different things


[01/08/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nazism just called themselves socialist


[01/08/2023 11:07 PM] 5298_
It's so far right it's become socialism

That must mean that the whole edge is covered in these points


[01/08/2023 11:10 PM] 5298_
That makes a lot of sense


[01/08/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Where you go so far one way you go the other


[01/08/2023 11:11 PM] 5298_
Imagine that as a ball, so now you have two centre points so you can either be none of them and be centrist or so far of all of them you become centrist

The Political Loop


[01/08/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That also means you can go so right wing that you become left wing that you become right wing again etc etc


[01/08/2023 11:16 PM] 5298_

[01/08/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_
So does that mean that at a certain point you're going more right than left even if you started left


[01/08/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Whatever that means probably


[01/08/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Mr. O'Neill, if I told you something that I needed you to keep secret, could you?


[01/08/2023 11:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[01/08/2023 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why would i not keep it


[01/08/2023 11:26 PM] 5298_
Well, there has been a reason I've been talking about Transgender people tonight. You cannot tell anyone this because I think you know the way people tend to react to this but I am transgender, I identify as a woman and I use the name May. I trust you to not tell anyone and I want to be able to live as myself around you. I won't make a big fuss over it but all I ask is that you don't tell anyone and in private you call me May and use she/her for me

[01/09/2023 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
idk


[01/09/2023 9:10 PM] 5298_
It's R.E. something Science I think


[01/09/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fucks sake re is so shit


[01/09/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not even really re


[01/09/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its more like christian education


[01/09/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ik its a catholic school


[01/09/2023 9:11 PM] 5298_
Catholic ( sometimes protestant and Judaism ) education


[01/09/2023 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it gets so boring hearing the same shit repeated for like 10 years


[01/09/2023 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
by some guy who is sometimes okay but most of the time not


[01/09/2023 9:11 PM] 5298_
To be fair it could be worse


[01/09/2023 9:11 PM] 5298_
We could just do Bible study


[01/09/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We pretty much do


[01/09/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I doubt i did well on my test


[01/09/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
I'm fairly confident


[01/09/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have nothing but hatred for the education system


[01/09/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I don't care if it's free education, it's shit education


[01/09/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mainly created so people don't think and just work


[01/09/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
I've had an idea


[01/09/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
Well, more of a realisation


[01/09/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What is your realisation


[01/09/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
Why didn't the school want us having the old testament?


[01/09/2023 9:15 PM] 5298_
I'm year 7 they only gave us the new testament but not the old one too


[01/09/2023 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because the old testament god is a fucking fuckering fucker


[01/09/2023 9:16 PM] 5298_
Even though Catholics follow the old testament and we do a lot of work in it, especially in year 8 we pretty much exclusively did old testament work so wouldn't it make sense to give the students a copy of the full Bible for them to study?


[01/09/2023 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/09/2023 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have a question


[01/09/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If God truly did exist, why not just reveal himself to us? People say it's a test of faith, but why should there be faith to test anyway. It's his own creation, and if he supposedly has control over us and wants to ensure that, why not just show himself to us?


[01/09/2023 9:18 PM] 5298_
God created man as a species of love and love can't exist without free will so God doesn't reveal Himself to give us free will even though He reveals Himself all the time


[01/09/2023 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Then If he truly did control everything, why make it so love can't exist without free will?


[01/09/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
He revealed himself to Adam, Eve, Job, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Abraham, Moses, Muhammad, Elijah, Jacob, David, Ezekiel, John, Samuel, Enoch, Joshua, Jesus, Jonah, Aaron, Daniel, Nathan, Philip, Ishmael, Mary and so so many more


[01/09/2023 9:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They aren't people of this time. Why not just reveal himself to us all now? If he wanted people to believe in Him, and not other Gods, why not just show Himself?


[01/09/2023 9:24 PM] 5298_
Every prophet, Apostle and freed slave of Exodus saw Him


[01/09/2023 9:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
People can see Him, without losing free will.


[01/09/2023 9:24 PM] 5298_
Not really


[01/09/2023 9:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How though?


[01/09/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why does collectively agreeing on an Idea make it so you have no free will


[01/09/2023 9:26 PM] 5298_
If a thundercloud came down to you and spoke to you and told you that He is the Almighty God and then cured you of any ailments wouldn't you immediately worship Him as God?


[01/09/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'd just think I'm schizophrenic


[01/09/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and if it was in those times probably


[01/09/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
I don't think schizophrenia can cure any ailment


[01/09/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Well


[01/09/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the voices can tell me that


[01/09/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You know how scientists believe the universe is conscious


[01/09/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
somke


[01/09/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
some


[01/09/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not all


[01/09/2023 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
obviously


[01/09/2023 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But some believe the universe might be conscious


[01/09/2023 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What if God isn't an entity like we're taught, but the universe itself


[01/09/2023 9:29 PM] 5298_
That would make sense, the universe is All Mighty and All Knowing


[01/09/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
God isn't the god in the christian sense


[01/09/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
where theres heaven and hell


[01/09/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He is just the universe


[01/09/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And we're also the universe


[01/09/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive just understood everything


[01/09/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We're the universe, and the universe is god


[01/09/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There isnt a heaven or hell, death is just you becoming god


[01/09/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or one with it


[01/09/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dylan


[01/09/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
this is our revelation


[01/09/2023 9:33 PM] 5298_
At this point I just want to lead a good life whether that be with science or faith


[01/09/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/09/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The galactic web is just the neurons and brain of the universe


[01/09/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if the universe is conscious


[01/09/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

If you give a walkey talkey to everyone in China is it a brain?


[01/09/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes


[01/09/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's processing information and using it


[01/09/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it isnt learning though


[01/09/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so it is a bit disable


[01/09/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
disabled


[01/09/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its like the brain dead children that you see on tiktok live that are being used for money


[01/09/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Imagine what history would be like if the moon was closer to earth


[01/09/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like when the moon rises over the horizon it brings a massive fucking wave and everyone panics


[01/09/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and eventually civilisation adapts to it


[01/09/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and they start worshipping the wave

That's how we defeat Climate change


[01/09/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am going to heavily contribute to climate change just so the netherlands and belgium go underwater


[01/09/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and some of france


[01/09/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I FUCKING HATE THE DUTCH AND BELGIANS


[01/09/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
AND FRENCH


[01/09/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WHAT DO YOU THINK


[01/09/2023 9:45 PM] 5298_
I'm going to live in the Pennines and heavily contribute to climate change in the hopes of sinking Birmingham


[01/09/2023 9:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
good thinking


[01/09/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I will create  a giant network of dams in the pennines and lake district


[01/09/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
turning them into one giant lake


[01/09/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then


[01/09/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then


[01/09/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i will break the birmingham dam


[01/09/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and release trillions of kgs of water


[01/09/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had another thought


[01/09/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
God creating himself is just like the universe creating itself


[01/09/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
at least thats what we believ


[01/09/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
believe


[01/09/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the universe created itself


[01/09/2023 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What do you think about my little idea


[01/09/2023 10:03 PM] 5298_
I'm not sure


[01/09/2023 10:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am also unsure of how good of an idea it is, but it sounds semi-reasonable if it's based on the idea of the universe being conscious


[01/09/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what the fuck


[01/09/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
how did we miss this

[01/09/2023 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What is the idea


[01/09/2023 10:08 PM] 5298_
The UK is trying to get to space for Helium-3


[01/09/2023 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

America is already ready to go into another space race with China over it and the UK needs an alternate power source and if they can get Helium-3 they might be able to afford the strikes


[01/09/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fucking hell


[01/09/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that actually makes sense

[01/09/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WHY IS THE UK IN THE SPACE RACE


[01/09/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
THE BRITISH SPACE PROGRAMME FINALLY HAS A USE


[01/09/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
The UK is fucked economically and if they can get their hands on Helium-3 they won't have to worry about the energy crisis and they'll be rich enough to afford pay rises


[01/09/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
HELIUM-3 COULD HELP SAVE BRITAIN


[01/09/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the plane will drop the satellite in 55 min


[01/09/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mins


[01/09/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what if the satellite just fucking falls cause of drag and it doesnt have enough energy to boost itself into space


[01/09/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and it becomes the third failure of the british space programme

That's eugenics


[01/10/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its a question on the political compass


[01/10/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There's some sort of morality to it though


[01/10/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Do you want your child to suffer for their own life?


[01/10/2023 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It is eugenics, but I feel like if you have a serious inheritable disability you should try to stay away from having children unless you want to cause a life of suffering


[01/10/2023 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It is your choice to have children


[01/10/2023 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Even if you do


[01/10/2023 9:21 PM] 5298_
The same can be said for everyone though


[01/10/2023 9:21 PM] 5298_
Everyone suffers in life and the parents are always parentally responsible because they brought that life into being


[01/10/2023 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[01/10/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
Every parent must be aware their child is going to suffer


[01/10/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But serious physical disabilities would cause much much much more pain and a shorter and unhappier life than someone who had not the best parents


[01/10/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you should take the political compass

[01/10/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What


[01/10/2023 9:24 PM] 5298_
We could both agree that pain is bad and please is good right?


[01/10/2023 9:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think a lot of people would agree on that


[01/10/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
So, an absence of pain is good and an absence of pleasure could be seen as bad or somewhere in the middle because you aren't suffering but you aren't happy


[01/10/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Anything else


[01/10/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
So in scenario A where a person does exist you can have pain and pleasure which is bad and good but in scenario B where a person doesn't exist you have an absence of pain and an absence of pleasure which is good and not bad


[01/10/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
Scenario B where the person is never born is the only scenario where nothing bad happens


[01/10/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/10/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_

[01/10/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because they accept pain

[01/10/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The absence of pain and pleasure is the exact thing, its not good, its not bad, its not in between since you cant make a decision based on that when you dont exist. The absence of pain and pleasure would only matter when a thing is conscious and aware like when a person has chromosone 6 deletion and can not feel emotion or pain etc


[01/10/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what i think

[01/10/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The term means simply that each worker in a socialist society receives compensation and benefits according to the quantity and value of the labor that they contributed.


[01/10/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_
no that's retarded


[01/10/2023 9:44 PM] 5298_

Marx was a retard


[01/10/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/10/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/10/2023 10:03 PM] 5298_
Yes, the best part of the compass ( I have never felt the touch of another woman )

What did you say


[01/11/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
I googled it and I got a public school


[01/11/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/11/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also gaelic is so heavily like latinised

I'm going to gas attack Mrs. Theaker, I fucking hate her she's a cunt


[01/11/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What did she do


[01/11/2023 10:52 PM] 5298_
She's just fucking boring and she moved us away from each other, and she thought you were gonna kill Daniel even though that's not how that would work. What did she even mean " people like you " those warnings are for three year old, is she calling you three


[01/11/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The school system is fucked I'm sick of it anyway


[01/11/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It says it seeks to educate, but it only seeks to educate people on how to work and how to think


[01/11/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's entirely outdated, and the ways it educates were adopted in the victorian times and still forced on us


[01/11/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
People actually have a type of anxiety called school anxiety from all the stress it causes


[01/11/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
I swear to God I'm just going to take all my money out at an ATM and just leave and go to Ireland


[01/11/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
There's a ¬£99 ferry to Dublin from Liverpool that leaves 16 times a day


[01/11/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
Let's go


[01/11/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You're forced to wake up at the crack of dawn, when during puberty your internal clock is offset by up to 2-3 hours in puberty, meaning that adolescents normally sleep in the early hours of the morning


[01/11/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
Let's get a ticket for the ferry and go to Ireland


[01/11/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So that means it causes more stress because you're brain cannot process the same level of information than when you're fully awake


[01/11/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
The school doesn't give a shit about us learning anything


[01/11/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/11/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They only see us as a commodity


[01/11/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Schools are only there to turn a profit


[01/11/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
They just need to give us information to regurgitate on our GCSE's so we can get jobs we most likely won't be happy in for years, probably decades


[01/11/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You have no choice as to whether you go or not, they force you to come in by dragging you out of bed


[01/11/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
I wish I was Scandinavian


[01/11/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
The Scandinavian countries have their shit sorted out


[01/11/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik


[01/11/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
I used to get like 2-4 panic attacks a day for weeks about school


[01/11/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm writing my shit in English on the education system and ik they probably always get them but I want mine to be impactful


[01/11/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also, when a child misbehaves, they don't educate them, they punish them


[01/11/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They think punishment if a form of education, but its not because it just makes them angrier towards the teacher and makes them more likely to do it again


[01/11/2023 11:02 PM] 5298_
You know what you're talking about, most people that do it about school are just the kids that don't want to do any school and want them all shut down


[01/11/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/11/2023 11:02 PM] 5298_
The punishments are just retarded


[01/11/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's not that I want school to be shut down, i think school is beneficial


[01/11/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But its the way its done that's wrong


[01/11/2023 11:03 PM] 5298_
The behaviour points are actually so retarded


[01/11/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How can they expect you to sit there for an hour and half without being distracted


[01/11/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's so uncomfortable


[01/11/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The school in Norway should be a prime example as to how schools all over the world should be


[01/11/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It shouldn't just be writing down in a book for 6 hours a day


[01/11/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There's a reason kids hate school and somehow the teachers don't see it


[01/11/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The only thing that's really changed since school in the victorian times and now is basically the technology available and you can't get smacked on the arse anymore


[01/11/2023 11:06 PM] 5298_
I'd rather people be smacked on the arse than the fucking behaviour points


[01/11/2023 11:06 PM] 5298_
At least that fucking does something


[01/11/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It doesn't achieve anything


[01/11/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And the fact that each school controls its own rules is absolutely fucking ridiculous


[01/11/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There should be 1 school system, where a set of rules are in place and they send an inspector every 2 weeks or so to ensure those rules are being followed


[01/11/2023 11:08 PM] 5298_
Abuse works but it's still not a good thing, it's negative reinforcement which all that does is traumatizes children


[01/11/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/11/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I don't see school as a "place of learning love and compassion" I see it as a giant roadblock in my life


[01/11/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When I'm sat there for 6 hours a day writing in a book with the way I am of course you're gonna have major issues


[01/11/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I mostly learn by doing shit, that's why I want a more hands on job


[01/11/2023 11:09 PM] 5298_
I don't want to go anymore it's so fucking retarded


[01/11/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My mums been fined because I didn't turn up to school


[01/11/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How fucking stupid is that


[01/11/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's completely fucking disgusting to be allowed the legal power to fine parents for not bringing their children into school


[01/11/2023 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They make millions every year just from finding parents


[01/11/2023 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fining


[01/11/2023 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm gonna go now


[01/11/2023 11:13 PM] 5298_
Bye bye Rylan, I can't wait for you to write in your school work how retarded school is

kaden macaloone in our year


[01/12/2023 7:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
big one


[01/12/2023 7:53 PM] 5298_
Gracie Adams said the nword


[01/12/2023 7:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Kaden macaloone saying it is funnier because he said hes never going to say it and never will lmfao


[01/12/2023 7:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

In Music today whilst revising in the computer rooms we were allowed to listen to music and she said "I don't like this song it has a swear word in it, it says n****r" I'm pretty sure that's a bit more than a swear word and you also can't say that


[01/12/2023 7:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/12/2023 7:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theres one thing wrong that mr odonnell said tho


[01/12/2023 7:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that is that if the earths orbit changed by 1 mile it would kill us


[01/12/2023 7:56 PM] 5298_
I think he means the overall orbit


[01/12/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure hes heard of the milankovitch cycles, but knowing him he probably has


[01/12/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yeah overall orbit changing by 1 mile wouldnt kill us either


[01/12/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It probably changes by 1 mile a day lmao


[01/12/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its such a tiny number


[01/12/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like varies i meant


[01/12/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its half of barrow


[01/12/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and also how if gravity was a bit stronger the big bang wouldnt have happened


[01/12/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
gravity came into existence with the universe, im pretty sure


[01/12/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i get the message though


[01/12/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he means everything is too perfect


[01/12/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I agree that everything is designed, but not by god


[01/12/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its designed by nature and the universe


[01/12/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i believe to some degree the universe is god


[01/12/2023 7:58 PM] 5298_

[01/12/2023 7:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im guessing what he meant by 1 mile was actually probably like 10 million


[01/12/2023 7:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or one million miles


[01/12/2023 7:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but one million miles wouldnt have a catastrophic impact


[01/12/2023 7:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the changes wouldnt be noticeable


[01/12/2023 8:01 PM] 5298_
That one's true, if gravity was slightly too weak or too strong either the atoms couldn't have formed together or would be too strong the gases wouldn't have formed or something to that effect it's been a while since I read up on it


[01/12/2023 8:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not what happens after it


[01/12/2023 8:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I mean the big bang itself


[01/12/2023 8:02 PM] 5298_
I think that it wasn't designed


[01/12/2023 8:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It wasnt designed by an entity


[01/12/2023 8:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was designed by itself is what im saying


[01/12/2023 8:04 PM] 5298_
If this is the way the Universe has to be for life to exist then it's either the universe is like that or it isn't. In the situation it doesn't exist we aren't observing it to know that and in the situation it does exist we are observing to know it exists. It doesn't need to be designed because it will always exist because it's either it does exist or existence as a concept doesn't exist


[01/12/2023 8:04 PM] 5298_
I've explained that horribly but I hope you get what I mean


[01/12/2023 8:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I do


[01/12/2023 8:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant wait to present my arguments on the flawed education system


[01/12/2023 8:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/12/2023 8:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might write a completely planned version of it now so i know where to statr


[01/12/2023 8:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/12/2023 8:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I HATE THE TERM CISHET


[01/12/2023 8:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ITS SO RETARDED


[01/12/2023 8:10 PM] 5298_
Why?


[01/12/2023 8:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It just is


[01/12/2023 8:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its cringy


[01/12/2023 8:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its like latinx


[01/12/2023 8:12 PM] 5298_
I don't see the problem with it, the people who use it in a derogatory way are retarded but it's a fine term


[01/12/2023 8:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I do


[01/12/2023 8:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its retarded


[01/12/2023 8:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what it is


[01/12/2023 8:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cishet sounds like a fucking nut not a way of calling someone straight


[01/12/2023 8:12 PM] 5298_
Well it's not just straight


[01/12/2023 8:12 PM] 5298_
It's Cisgender and straight


[01/12/2023 8:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cisgender and cissexual

cisgender is just identifying as your biological sex and cissexual is being attracted to the opposite sex


[01/12/2023 8:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So its just straight because theres no leaning on the lgbt spectrum


[01/12/2023 8:14 PM] 5298_
Cissexual is a synonym of Cisgender, it's hetrosexual you mean


[01/12/2023 8:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same fucking tihng


[01/12/2023 8:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thing


[01/12/2023 8:15 PM] 5298_
What are your opinions on the superstriaght thing


[01/12/2023 8:15 PM] 5298_
I think it's fucking retarded


[01/12/2023 8:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's just straight


[01/12/2023 8:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
With your preferences


[01/12/2023 8:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's retarded to call it a different sexuality

[01/12/2023 8:17 PM] 5298_
I think the people that don't date cis or trans people exclusively. C4C and T4T are both equally retarded


[01/12/2023 8:17 PM] 5298_
What does that mean, it seems ominous


[01/12/2023 8:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont know


[01/12/2023 8:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what is c4c and t4t


[01/12/2023 8:18 PM] 5298_
C4C is superstriaght, cis for cis and T4T is trans people that only date other trans people


[01/12/2023 8:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why should that have any effect on me though, it's just people having preferences at the end of the day


[01/12/2023 8:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's only when discrimination comes into play that is an issue really


[01/12/2023 8:22 PM] 5298_
Yeah, I think people can have preferences but making it a sexuality is retarded as anything


[01/12/2023 8:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats right about where i stand


[01/12/2023 8:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
anyway


[01/12/2023 8:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My 1st great grandmother is the last fully irish-blooded member of my family tree, but she was born in ü§Æ salford


[01/12/2023 8:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They lived in a lovely little fucking irish village and moved to salford


[01/12/2023 8:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The economy was probably bad though


[01/12/2023 8:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
At that time


[01/12/2023 8:23 PM] 5298_
I googled Salford and immediately it was a headline about a stabbing


[01/12/2023 8:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You see what i mean

my nana didnt know what grass looked like until she was evacuated


[01/12/2023 8:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She was 5 at the time so probably in 1941


[01/12/2023 8:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My family was known in the area


[01/12/2023 8:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my granddad was john 'dinks' harris


[01/12/2023 8:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you probably wont know him


[01/12/2023 8:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but older members of the community probably do


[01/12/2023 8:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He played for barrow's rugby time

From that quote alone I like your nana


[01/12/2023 8:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She was funny too


[01/12/2023 8:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wish she lived a bit longer though cause i would find it fascinating to talk to her


[01/12/2023 8:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
she knew much more about my family tree than i do


[01/12/2023 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/12/2023 9:02 PM] 5298_
It's completely silent for me


[01/12/2023 9:03 PM] 5298_
Which direction is the wind coming from?


[01/12/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Fucking hell I hear now


[01/12/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Gusting up to 65mph


[01/12/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
hurricane force is 74mph


[01/12/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ive only been through that once


[01/12/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
during ophelia


[01/12/2023 9:04 PM] 5298_
Ophelia sounds dodgy


[01/12/2023 9:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Do you not remember it


[01/12/2023 9:04 PM] 5298_
No


[01/12/2023 9:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Hurricane ophelia


[01/12/2023 9:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
October 16th 2017


[01/12/2023 9:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I remember that date because i was excited to see what it would bring


[01/12/2023 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was only 6-12 hours away from making a tropical landfall in ireland


[01/12/2023 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it wouldve been the first recorded case of that happening


[01/12/2023 9:05 PM] 5298_
I do remember


[01/12/2023 9:06 PM] 5298_
I wasn't told it was Hurricane Ophelia though so that's why I didn't remember


[01/12/2023 9:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to trick someone into searching er*******s


[01/12/2023 9:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the word which gets you tracked


[01/12/2023 9:06 PM] 5298_
But I do remember my neighbors tree being pulled out the ground


[01/12/2023 9:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
For us it was ex-hurricane ophelia or storm ophelia


[01/12/2023 9:06 PM] 5298_
What word?


[01/12/2023 9:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/12/2023 9:07 PM] 5298_
I don't know the rest

Oh


[01/12/2023 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just realised for some fucking reason some of the videos ive watched pop up on my fucking bernards account


[01/12/2023 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i went through it


[01/12/2023 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and there was some black man dancing to chinese propaganda music


[01/12/2023 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and some retarded memes


[01/12/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
HOLY SHIT


[01/12/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I JUST REALISED I MIGHT BE ABLE TO REMOVE SMOOTHWALL FROM MY GOOGLE ACCOUNT

[01/12/2023 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not been like that in so long


[01/12/2023 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was nearly falling over when walking through the bridge near my house


[01/12/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
It's weird seeing Wendigoon in anything other than a weird shirt


[01/12/2023 9:15 PM] 5298_
I also don't like knowing his name


[01/12/2023 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[01/12/2023 9:16 PM] 5298_
I don't know, it's like learning a teacher's first name. You know them by one name for so long then you get another one


[01/12/2023 9:17 PM] 5298_
I guess it's the same me going from Dylan to May though


[01/12/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah i always write dylan then delete it and change it to may


[01/12/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cause im not used to writing it yet


[01/12/2023 9:17 PM] 5298_
I'm still going to call him Wendigoon and not Isaiah


[01/12/2023 9:18 PM] 5298_
The important bit is that you change it, thank you for that by the way


[01/12/2023 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its going to be harder though because i still call you dylan in person


[01/12/2023 9:19 PM] 5298_
Yeah, it's weird and a pain but I can't have anyone call me May in public I would actually be fucking killed


[01/12/2023 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/12/2023 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
change that to all schools and ill be happy

Our school won't strike


[01/12/2023 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Do the teachers get adequate pay for what they deal with?


[01/12/2023 9:21 PM] 5298_
It's not a part of a union it's a part of Matter Christi so they won't strike


[01/12/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They can still strike


[01/12/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
AND IF THEY DONT


[01/12/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LIKE YOU SAID


[01/12/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY WONT


[01/12/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I WILL MAKE THEM BY CREATING 923849834 PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES


[01/12/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
They could but without a trade union it wouldn't be that beneficial


[01/12/2023 9:24 PM] 5298_
Terrorism


[01/12/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
Why is that the first suggestion

if max williams decides to wage war on us in the forest


[01/12/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When he goes home, we're going to fucking bomb his village


[01/12/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im not joking


[01/12/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we need to figure out how to make one but once we do if he does out to us his little village will be a crater


[01/12/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we should also rob all his shit


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
Take all his money and resources


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
plunder his village


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
You can do the bombing


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we can both do it


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's a team effort


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we wait for them all to leave


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
We're going to prison aren't we


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
presumably after destroying everything


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but its for a good cause


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then we sneak to his den


[01/12/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
make sure nobody is around


[01/12/2023 9:28 PM] 5298_
HE'S NEAR A FARM


[01/12/2023 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then plant it


[01/12/2023 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fuck the farm

RYLAN WE'RE FUCKED

[01/12/2023 9:28 PM] 5298_

What's it called when you like jump on to a moving train so you get a free ride


[01/12/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Train surfing


[01/12/2023 9:30 PM] 5298_
We can do that


[01/12/2023 9:30 PM] 5298_
Bomb his place and run the tracks and train surf the fuck out there


[01/12/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We can't go on the tracks because trains will be on


[01/12/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so we have to take the super long way around


[01/12/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or just run up the ormsgill coast and return not too long later


[01/12/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or


[01/12/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we just fucking burn his den down


[01/12/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
take a bottle of water for after the burning


[01/12/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
That's the whole point Rylan, we jump onto the train


[01/12/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so it doesnt spread


[01/12/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
That's a recipe for disaster


[01/12/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes i know


[01/12/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but with the right measures it wont be


[01/12/2023 9:33 PM] 5298_
I don't want to be complicit in you bombing a village and burning Sowerby down


[01/12/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[01/12/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you worded it like its horrible


[01/12/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we wouldnt burn sowerby down


[01/12/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and the ra bombed many villages


[01/12/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in the 80s at least


[01/12/2023 9:34 PM] 5298_
That's for anti-imperialism though


[01/12/2023 9:34 PM] 5298_
We don't need to bomb him


[01/12/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
OUR MAX VILLAGE DESTRUCTION WOULD BE ANTI IMPERIALIST


[01/12/2023 9:34 PM] 5298_
We can do much worse


[01/12/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He declares war on us to invade us for resources


[01/12/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And to control our area for


[01/12/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you guessed it


[01/12/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
stealing OUR resources


[01/12/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
for HIS gain


[01/12/2023 9:35 PM] 5298_
Take all his shit and then dismantle his village take any good wood or stones and douse the rest in water so it becomes weak


[01/12/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMAO


[01/12/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Burning would do the trick too


[01/12/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Just bring loads of water


[01/12/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and maybe sand


[01/12/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And for stones


[01/12/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the heat would cause them to explode


[01/12/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
You just want to blow something up don't you


[01/12/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes


[01/12/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
UP THE RA


[01/12/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
UP THE RA


[01/12/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
We should make a codex so that we can discuss plans in the woods and Max doesn't know what we mean


[01/12/2023 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[01/12/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
So we can say we're going to blow his house to Kingdom Come without him knowing


[01/12/2023 9:40 PM] 5298_
What the fuck do I say to my mum when I say I'm going out with my friend for the day and I come back and there's been a terrorist attacks in Sowerby woods while I've been out


[01/12/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[01/12/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wrote this as an introduction


[01/12/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
School. A place of learning. As quoted by this school it's a "place of learning, love and compassion". But is it really? At the end of the day, you spend years and years of your life sitting in a classroom for about 6 hours a day, where you actions are policied by a teacher, where the seconds tick by as slow as a sloth. Now you probably think I am going to talk about completely getting rid of the school system, however that is not my intention. My intention is to bring light to the changes that need to occur.


[01/12/2023 9:42 PM] 5298_
What's that train spotting app?


[01/12/2023 9:42 PM] 5298_
That's really good


[01/12/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We are not train surfing


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_
Why


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cause we would die


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_
I just want to in general


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You have to do it at a stop im pretty sure


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_
You're probably right but I don't think bombing a village is any safer


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
no chance youre jumping onto one without getting ripped apart


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
youre making this sound so bad


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its a den and a fire


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that is empty


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_
That's because it is


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and we would just run


[01/12/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
for the hills


[01/12/2023 9:44 PM] 5298_
You're bombing a village


[01/12/2023 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We're*

[01/12/2023 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If i die soon and they go through my phone i wonder what theyll think


[01/12/2023 9:44 PM] 5298_
Bolt it to Lindal


[01/12/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or if school search my phone


[01/12/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if school searches my phone i will have no choice in life


[01/12/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i will have to become a terrorist


[01/12/2023 9:45 PM] 5298_
If anyone searches my phone I'm going away for decades


[01/12/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that would be my only hope


[01/12/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because i can not join the british army


[01/12/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
for starters i hate the british army


[01/12/2023 9:45 PM] 5298_
Morally or legally


[01/12/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and secondly i probably have a mental illness so they cant take me in


[01/12/2023 9:48 PM] 5298_
I think it would be fun to leave for a day


[01/12/2023 9:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Where? school?


[01/12/2023 9:48 PM] 5298_
No, Barrow


[01/12/2023 9:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[01/12/2023 9:51 PM] 5298_
Some weekend or holiday let's just see how far away we could get before we would have to turn back


[01/12/2023 9:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I did walk to south end once


[01/12/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that is like 10-11 miles away


[01/12/2023 9:52 PM] 5298_
Where's south end?


[01/12/2023 9:52 PM] 5298_
That's probably a stupid question

[01/12/2023 9:52 PM] 5298_
Oh right


[01/12/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
6.6 miles


[01/12/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We set off at 3pm and didnt get there till 6-7


[01/12/2023 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It takes about the same amount of time to get to ulverston


[01/12/2023 9:53 PM] 5298_
I think we could make it quite far up

We set off at 10am, we would get there at 4 and be home at anywhere from 10pm-12am


[01/12/2023 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe later


[01/12/2023 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and thats assuming we dont stop


[01/12/2023 9:54 PM] 5298_
We could probably get up to Marton


[01/12/2023 9:55 PM] 5298_
Here's an idea, I really want to go more north because the most north I've been is Ulverston


[01/12/2023 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Really?


[01/12/2023 9:55 PM] 5298_
Nevermind


[01/12/2023 9:56 PM] 5298_
I'm a fucking retard I forgot where the lake District is


[01/12/2023 9:57 PM] 5298_
Keswick is the most north I've been


[01/12/2023 9:57 PM] 5298_
But anyways


[01/12/2023 9:58 PM] 5298_
We should get a train out of Furness and start our walk there and then do some maths to figure out how long we can walk for before having to go back to the train and back home


[01/12/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
School. A place of learning. As quoted by this school it's a "place of learning, love and compassion". But is it really? At the end of the day, you spend years and years of your life sitting in a classroom for about 6 hours a day, where your actions are policied by a teacher, where the seconds tick by as slow as a sloth. Now you probably think I am going to talk about completely getting rid of the school system. However, that is not my intention; I intend to bring light to the changes that need to occur.

To begin with, we must discuss the time at which we are forced to come into school. Coming into school at 8:30 am will and does have stark consequences on the mental well-being of children. Every single day, you will hear students complaining of being tired, but each time it is blamed on a poor sleep schedule. In actuality, during adolescence, the internal clock of a person is shifted by upwards of 2-3 hours. This leads to a child who previously slept at 9pm to start sleeping at 10pm, 11pm, 12am or later. A developing teenager needs around 9-10 hours of sleep, and as such, waking up at 7am to get ready for school can have dire effects on learning. Research has proven that a 10:30am start to school drastically improves performance.

It was far across the sea
When the Devil got ahold of me
He wouldn't set me free
So he kept me soul for ransom

I'm a sailor man from Glasgow town
I've sailed this world around and round 
He's the meanest thing that I had found
In all me days of wandering

And I could see his evil eyes 
But stead he took me by surprise
Take me to your paradise 
I want to see the jungle

Here we go again
We're on the road again
We're in the road again
We're on our way to paradise
We love the jungle deep 
That's where the lion sleeps
For then those evil eyes 
They have no place in paradise

Graffiti on the wall just as the sun was going down
I see graffiti on the wall
For the Celts
For the Celts 
I see graffiti on the wall that says
We're magic
We're magic 
Graffiti on the wall
Graffiti on the wall
And it says 

Ooh ah up the ra
Say ooh ah up the ra
Ooh ah up the ra
Say ooh ah up the ra
Ooh ah up the ra
Say ooh ah up the ra
Ooh ah up the ra
Say ooh ah up the ra
Ooh ah up the ra
Say ooh ah up the ra
Ooh ah up the ra
Say ooh ah up the ra

[01/13/2023 7:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Part 1 of the toilets issue


[01/13/2023 7:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Second of all, I would like to speak about toilets. How are teachers allowed to refuse access to them? I understand that it is in the School‚Äôs best interest to stop damage from being caused to them, and to stop congregations of people forming there after break, normally to skip lessons. But, why should everyone be punished for a minority‚Äôs actions? Why should we sit there for upwards of one hour and thirty-five minutes just to use such a common thing in our lives? Refusal to use the School‚Äôs toilets goes against the Human Right to Sanitation (Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights or ICESCR, ‚Äúthe right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family‚Äù) but for some reason the School System appears to be granted the right to break Human Rights. Why is nothing being done about this?


[01/13/2023 7:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Another issue with toilets is how utterly disgusting they are. Everyone in the school is familiar with the disgusting grime that crawls along the floor and climbs the walls, the miasma of the bathrooms which makes you retch. There are always crowds of people there during break and dinnertime, which can get rather irritating, and by the end of it there is rubbish plaguing the floor, toilet paper clinging onto the walls among a seemingly never-ending list of damage. All of this should be preventable, yet it somehow isn‚Äôt.


[01/13/2023 7:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Part 2


[01/13/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What do you think may


[01/13/2023 7:58 PM] 5298_
It's very good and I love the descriptive language and using real sources to back up your argument


[01/13/2023 7:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ive added a bit more to the descriptive language parts because it didnt fully capture the image


[01/13/2023 7:59 PM] 5298_
On the subject itself I don't really have an opinion, I think the reason they don't let you go is because the lessons used to be much shorter so it was a feasible time to wait but now the lessons are longer it isn't a normal time to wait and they haven't changed the rule


[01/13/2023 8:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/13/2023 8:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might add something in about that


[01/13/2023 8:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But


[01/13/2023 8:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Actually


[01/13/2023 8:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill add in a bit about toilet passes


[01/13/2023 8:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Toilet Passes are another big issue, because they don‚Äôt exactly achieve anything, but make students feel more frustrated. I understand people may have disabilities which affect their bladder, or bowels Pass holders are immediately allowed to go to the toilet, but people who don‚Äôt not hold a pass will probably be refused. When they‚Äôre refused, they become more upset about it, seeing a peer being able to freely use the toilets, and it becomes more likely for them to concentrate less. Why would you want someone not to work when the whole point of school is to learn and to work? Along with this, some students use this to their advantage and go off to who knows where.

allow me to fix them


[01/13/2023 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thirdly, the punishment system is flawed. A major part of the education system is the punishment system. Punishment is meant to be a form of reinforcing a certain behaviour, however, for the most part, it fails to achieve it‚Äôs own goals. Unless someone is from a super strict household, being punished is received as a joke; laughable. It is a great example of a negative reinforcement. You remove a stimulus from the student‚Äôs environment, this may be that they‚Äôre no longer able to see their friends, or they have to stay after school. This seems to work in theory, but in reality a whole other story is told. When a student is punished, it makes them have some form of anger towards that teacher. This anger needs to release itself and, as such, this release comes in the form of disrupting lessons, being horrible to people and wanting to do damage to the school. Eventually, people who also agree that a teacher may be annoying, will begin to repeat them and slowly the whole school escalates into chaos.

I need you to point anything out so i can make it as good as possible


[01/13/2023 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
School. A place of learning. As quoted by this school it is a "place of learning, love and compassion". But is it really? At the end of the day, you spend years and years of your life sitting in a classroom for about 6 hours a day, where your actions are policed by a teacher, where the seconds tick by as slow as a sloth. Now you probably think I am going to talk about completely getting rid of the school system. However, that is not my intention; I intend to bring light to the changes that need to occur. 

To begin with, we must discuss the time at which we are forced to come into school. Coming into school at 8:30 am will and does have stark consequences on the mental well-being of children. Every single day, you will hear students complaining of being tired, but every single time it is blamed on a poor sleep schedule. In actuality, during adolescence, the internal clock of a person is shifted by upwards of 2-3 hours. This leads to a child who previously slept at 9pm to start sleeping at 10pm, 11pm, 12am or later. A developing teenager needs around 9-10 hours of sleep, and as such, waking up at 7am to get ready for school can have dire effects on learning. Research has proven that a 10:30am start to school drastically improves performance, leading to better mental health and behaviour all around the school.

Why are they still allowed to operate as such?

Behaviour points are a ridiculous concept and I am not sure why they were implemented. The idea is good in theory, students are punished with behaviour points because having behaviour points show where they are going wrong, it also informs their parents about what they have done wrong, and allows any issues to be dealt with at home. However, a lot of students do not see behaviour points as a punishment, but rather as an achievement; like medals of sorts. This leads to students trying to see who can get the most behaviour points, and, obviously, misbehaviour. Now, you may think that this should apply to achievement points, but you would be wrong. In school, anyone who performs well is bombarded with insults just because they are getting on, and this leads to people finding it weird to compete for achievement points. They aren‚Äôt seen as achievement points, but just as points with no social benefits.


[01/13/2023 10:13 PM] 5298_
I really like it, I especially like the part on the punishments. I've always fucking hated the punishments. I think that you could morph the second and third paragraph on toilets together because they cover many of the same points


[01/13/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/13/2023 10:14 PM] 5298_
Should I start on mine?

[01/13/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes

People think we've found evidence of Hawking Radiation


[01/13/2023 11:45 PM] 5298_
They made a Black Hole in a lab and it began glowing and people think it's Hawking Radiation, I haven't read up on it yet but it seems unlikely because the only article I could find was by cosmos magazine

[01/14/2023 3:30 PM] 5298_
I don't think The Line will work


[01/14/2023 3:31 PM] 5298_
It's so stupid, people think that it will solve homelessness because they can house so many people in such a small area but to rent one of those houses will probably cost more than to buy a house in a normal city


[01/14/2023 4:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its probably what the future looks like


[01/14/2023 4:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its similar to some of the things ive imagined future cities will be like


[01/14/2023 4:06 PM] 5298_
It's a good idea but it's going to be poorly executed


[01/14/2023 4:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im interested in it because it seems strange


[01/14/2023 4:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yeah


[01/14/2023 4:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theyre also building a hexagon city if i remember correctky


[01/14/2023 4:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
correctly

[01/14/2023 4:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wonder what myths the line will spawn


[01/14/2023 4:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
inside of it


[01/14/2023 4:12 PM] 5298_
A glass oasis in a dead desert is bound to spawn some tales


[01/14/2023 4:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/14/2023 4:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
all the neom projects look awesome atm


[01/14/2023 4:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i wonder if theyll look similar to the artist renditions


[01/14/2023 4:14 PM] 5298_
The sand outside the line will be incredibly hot


[01/14/2023 4:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/14/2023 4:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there will probably be exits to enter the desert but i doubt many people would


[01/14/2023 4:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
this seems nearly impossible though

[01/14/2023 4:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if they pull it off thatd be awesome


[01/14/2023 4:18 PM] 5298_
I'd rather die then live there


[01/14/2023 4:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Anxiety would be through the roof


[01/14/2023 4:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think all the projects look amazing, its just a matter of if they pull it off properly or do a portland walk


[01/14/2023 4:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
where something huge is promised but only a tiny disgusting thing is made


[01/14/2023 4:20 PM] 5298_
It's the stress of a normal city but they've made it a labyrinth so you can never escape the bustle and noise


[01/14/2023 4:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cars are banned from the neom projects


[01/14/2023 4:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so itll literally just be people talking


[01/14/2023 4:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i wonder how they will combat noise though


[01/14/2023 4:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if i had to guess theyd soundproof buildings


[01/14/2023 4:21 PM] 5298_
It's still an echo chamber


[01/14/2023 4:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The parks would also suppress sound


[01/14/2023 4:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
true


[01/14/2023 4:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyll have ways of combatting it because noise sickness can be quite a big issue


[01/14/2023 4:21 PM] 5298_
Even without cars it would still be awful


[01/14/2023 4:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Imagine how many videos will be made about walking to the other side


[01/14/2023 4:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i honestly wonder the long term impacts of the line


[01/14/2023 4:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
imagine new languages completely different to arabic evolve lmfao


[01/14/2023 4:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
imagine if they made it look like this

[01/14/2023 4:23 PM] 5298_
I wonder when they'll make them next to each other, so you have rows and rows through the desert of the Line cities with bridges connecting them


[01/14/2023 4:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats one of the artist renditions of it


[01/14/2023 4:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so much nature in a city


[01/14/2023 4:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyre making 2 so it isnt implausible


[01/14/2023 4:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

People say we need to grow up. No we don't. Growing up is this, it's becoming selfish and blind. People need to be kids again. To see everything and wonder what it is and invent wonderful stories for the most mundane things, to ask the kid in the corner if he wants to play with you, to tell stories, to not believe in strangers and say hi to everyone, and be nice to everyone because all you know is kindness

Good Evening. 
Today, unsuccessful talks have taken place between our humble nation, and the South. Unfortunately, tensions remain high with South Walnesian troops stationed along our border, and no plans or arrangements made to remove them from such positions.

Recent events have reminded us of the violent nature of the Southern beast which is eyeing up our borders as though they are food. As President of this nation, it is my duty to protect my people, and to ensure everyone lives long, fulfilling lives. And, protect we will. In the coming weeks, I regret to inform that our military will be stationed across our border, to expel any attempts at invading this peaceful land. However, do not allow anxiety to seep it's way into your life. We guarantee the safety of your loved ones, and we shall and will remain victorious should any attempts to invade us happen.

Thank you, 
President Rylan JC O'Neill-Price

[01/15/2023 1:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have come to the conclusion that we are the same person separated by almighty God the Father into 2 separate entities


[01/15/2023 1:07 AM] 5298_
There's a Greek myth about that


[01/15/2023 1:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There are too many coincidences for this not to be the case


[01/15/2023 1:08 AM] 5298_
It's more about soul mates though


[01/15/2023 1:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We have the same interests, both have very similar first names, we probably have a similar thought process, both are retarded, both want Irish unification


[01/15/2023 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same name? Bit daft of me


[01/15/2023 1:09 AM] 5298_
Both Irish


[01/15/2023 1:09 AM] 5298_
Both have similar political ideologies


[01/15/2023 1:09 AM] 5298_
Both are probably Autistic


[01/15/2023 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/15/2023 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We're a manifestation of one entity

[01/15/2023 1:11 AM] 5298_

[01/15/2023 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I made sure it wasnt binned too cause when my room was being moved around i searched through the bins and couldnt find it


[01/15/2023 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/15/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
That's fucking shit, why would she do that


[01/15/2023 10:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/15/2023 10:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I told her and made sure she wouldnt but i went for a few hours and it went


[01/15/2023 10:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Ive been feeling hopeless and dread all day but now i just feel worse


[01/15/2023 10:22 PM] 5298_

[01/17/2023 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive made some improvements


[01/17/2023 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because the original paragraphs didnt make as much sense


[01/17/2023 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Over the last few decades, the education system has continued to spiral downhill. It fails thousands in it‚Äôs main job: to provide a good and clear education to students. Students arrive at school everyday, expecting to be taught to an adequate standard. However, this is not the case. I believe that the school systems requires reform and change urgently. If this is not achieved. the youth of this nation will fall behind on many opportunities. However, I am not here to call for the removal of the school system; I believe that is an utterly idiotic idea.

Firstly, students are forced into school at ridiculous times. This must be changed, as for the vast majority of students, sleeping later on is the standard. During adolescence, the internal clock of a person shifts by upwards of 2-3 hours; this means a child who previously slept at 9pm would start sleeping at around 11pm, 12am or later. At most, a student of this nature would be getting 7 hours of sleep. They are missing out on hours of sleeping, falling behind the 9 hour mark, required for efficient bodily functions, like: concentrating, growth and development of the Brain. Studies have proven time and time again that a 10:30am start to school can improve performance, can improve mental health (a growing issue in younger generations) and behaviour all around. Why would school want to impact their student‚Äôs life and career in such a way? British Schools ought to change their starting times.


[01/17/2023 7:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Secondly, the toilets are a disgrace, especially in this school. First off, why are teachers 
granted the permission to refuse access to something which is so vital to the day-to-day function of someone? I understand that the school‚Äôs interest is to keep property from being damaged, and to stop crowds of people from forming there after break and dinner. However, why is it that everyone must be punished for the actions of a minority? Why are we forced to wait for upwards of one hour and thirty-five minutes just to use them? In fact, refusing to allow this is a violation of Human Rights, specifically the Human Right to Sanitation (read Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights or ICESCR, ‚Äúthe right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family‚Äù). But, for some reason these breaches of Human Rights are acceptable in the eyes of OFSTED, and the government. Some students, including myself, refuse to drink a lot in school in case I need to go to the toilet, because I know I will likely be refused access. Furthermore, the walls and floor in both bathrooms are crawling with grime, and the miasma it releases coats your nose as though it were mucus. Why is nothing being done to ensure the cleanliness of the bathrooms? Why is it that between break times, they are not cleaned? Maybe they are, but to the degree they are cleaned is not clear, as to the naked eye and nose there is no difference.

Greta thunberg is so much for climate activism but nobody seems to realise that the batteries in her electric cars and boats were mined by child slaves


[01/17/2023 9:57 PM] 5298_
And the phone you're using was made by child slaves who now have cobalt and plastic in their blood, same with your clothes. No one is innocent, no one is perfect but the ones who realise that are better then the ones who revel in it


[01/17/2023 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
good


[01/17/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
jk


[01/17/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know that we all have shit made by child slaves in sweat shops or who mined for weeks, but Greta Thunberg and the media paint the picture of her as absolutely perfect with no issues, Im 99% certain she herself believes she is perfect


[01/17/2023 9:59 PM] 5298_
We should go on school strike


[01/17/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/17/2023 10:04 PM] 5298_
She's 20 now so in 2019 she was 16 which means she was just about to finish school. That is a shit protest


[01/17/2023 10:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She was 15 as a matter of fact


[01/17/2023 10:04 PM] 5298_

"Treated me not unlike a young stallion; quick ride after which she'd smack my rump and send me off to graze, among the many parts about it that were wrong was that it happened in a field behind a busy pub"

What if the universe is infinite with a finite amount of things in it


[01/17/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
That fucks with my head


[01/17/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The universe has always existed, it just took matter a long ass time to catch up


[01/17/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like


[01/17/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The universe has existed for infinity, and will exist for infinity but matter did not exist until the big bang


[01/17/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That sounds awful


[01/17/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Holy shit


[01/17/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i cant comprehend the fact that there was never a start point and it always existed


[01/17/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It existed for infinity and it will exist for infinity


[01/17/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that sounds fucked


[01/17/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
I'm too tired for this, my brain hurts now


[01/17/2023 11:03 PM] 5298_

[01/18/2023 5:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What was wrong


[01/18/2023 5:32 PM] 5298_
I was already a bit upset because I'd seen a teacher have a full breakdown. She was sat under the Furness stairs sobbing and I went to ask if she was alright and she seemed like she wanted to be alone. Then Ella just kept asking me if I'd like kill her over and over so I left then some year 7s were grabbing me when I was going into Furness so I told them to kill themselves and stormed into F1 where Mrs. Ritchie and Mrs. Wood trapped me in so I had a full panic attack and sat in a corner crying for the rest of the day


[01/18/2023 5:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fucking hell


[01/18/2023 5:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That school is fucking awful


[01/18/2023 5:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/18/2023 5:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh not sure who they are


[01/18/2023 5:33 PM] 5298_
She got a message on her phone during form and broke down crying


[01/18/2023 5:34 PM] 5298_
She's the small blonde one in the hub


[01/18/2023 5:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[01/18/2023 5:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That school is so fucked


[01/18/2023 5:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My mum fucking hates it just as much as me


[01/18/2023 5:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My family said i should get into politics cause my mum told them about my speech about corruption in the school system and they praised me lmao


[01/18/2023 5:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/18/2023 6:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but they havent


[01/18/2023 6:39 PM] 5298_
I think they found something


[01/18/2023 6:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same


[01/18/2023 6:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They might have also not found something


[01/18/2023 6:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or it wasnt scheduled at all and i took it out of context


[01/18/2023 6:40 PM] 5298_
And they're doing further tests to see if they actually did find something


[01/18/2023 6:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/18/2023 6:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what i think


[01/18/2023 7:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I used to be able to get shit done till lockdown came around and it completely destroyed my mental health


[01/18/2023 7:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i still struggled to concentrate but i managed to get loads of work done


[01/18/2023 7:48 PM] 5298_
Well you've been doing really well recently, especially in English


[01/18/2023 7:49 PM] 5298_
93% on your test and you've been drafting your final piece for this topic and your letter was really good from the bits I read


[01/18/2023 7:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
English is like the only thing i do well at


[01/18/2023 7:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Everything else is utter shit


[01/18/2023 7:55 PM] 5298_
English is one of the only reasons I go to school


[01/18/2023 7:56 PM] 5298_
If it wasn't for English, History, Art, P.E. and John Muir I wouldn't go to school


[01/18/2023 7:58 PM] 5298_
The Hub is fucking awful now, I'm going back to when I had panic attacks every day. It feels like that time again, I dread every day


[01/18/2023 8:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont feel like i have a reason to go to school


[01/18/2023 8:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
every lesson apart from english i get work done


[01/18/2023 8:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I fucking dread coming in every day


[01/18/2023 8:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It feels more like torture than education


[01/18/2023 8:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dread everyday because I know im there for nothing

I am going through a period of derealisation


[01/18/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I genuinely do not think im real


[01/18/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But its been like this for days


[01/18/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_
I'm not entirely sure how to help with this but you're pretty real to me


[01/18/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No i dont think its an issue


[01/18/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im just saying


[01/18/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
For me it's a massive issue


[01/18/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Is it


[01/18/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
I get really bad anxiety from it


[01/18/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Damn bro


[01/18/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[01/18/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So silly sentence


[01/18/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I get random bouts of anxiety thinking about it sometimes


[01/18/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because im scared theres a bigger picture and its only a tiny piece of it


[01/18/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but other than that it doesnt cause me any anxiety at the moment


[01/18/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Just feels weird


[01/18/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
I feel so disconnected that either everyone I love isn't real because I'm not real which is awful or everyone I hate is a figment of my imagination which means they're constantly thinking about me because they're intrinsically connected to me


[01/18/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think everything is reality, but not real in a way


[01/18/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like how quantum mechanics basically means the universe didnt actually exist until i was born

Have you heard of the apple in the box?


[01/18/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[01/18/2023 11:04 PM] 5298_
It's a theory that if you put an apple in a box and leave it for an infinite amount of time then all the atoms in it will decay and reform and in that infinite amount of time that apple will change into everything that could ever exist an infinite amount of times


[01/18/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh yeah

[01/18/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Half-fillipino


[01/18/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i saw them at the very end of july


[01/18/2023 11:06 PM] 5298_
I can't remember the number but there's a theory that everyone is connected by a certain amount of people, I think it's 7


[01/18/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But i didnt realise that they were related to me


[01/18/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its 16


[01/18/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think


[01/18/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But they are 2nd cousins


[01/18/2023 11:07 PM] 5298_
It's 6 degrees of separation


[01/18/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
All organisms on earth are related


[01/18/2023 11:09 PM] 5298_
With 6 people or less I am related to Mr. Higgins


[01/18/2023 11:09 PM] 5298_
It's definitely through my Grandad


[01/18/2023 11:10 PM] 5298_
I know my grandad which gives me links to Ireland and then 5 more people will get me to Michael Higgins


[01/18/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What is the likelihood that i am related to the cheddar man


[01/18/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
would that give me the right to say the n word


[01/18/2023 11:11 PM] 5298_
No it wouldn't


[01/18/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/18/2023 11:11 PM] 5298_
You need to be black passing to say the n word


[01/18/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/19/2023 9:07 PM] 5298_
I've figured out who The Young Wolfe Tones are


[01/19/2023 9:08 PM] 5298_
It's an ex member of The Wolfe Tones who made his own band with younger members


[01/19/2023 9:08 PM] 5298_
So there's this like 70 year old man in a band with like 30 year olds


[01/19/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
It's just a broad black brimmer ribbons frayed and torn
By the careless whisk of many a mountain breeze
An old trench coat that's so battle stained and worn
And breeches almost threadbare at the knees
A Sam Browne belt with the buckle big and strong
And a holster that's been empty many's a day, but not for long
But when men claim Ireland's freedom the one who'll choose to lead them
Will wear the broad black brimmer of the IRA


[01/19/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
I want to get an Easter Lily pin

[01/20/2023 7:54 PM] 5298_
I think it's got cancer


[01/20/2023 7:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why could I not message you before? Was your phone being searched?


[01/20/2023 7:55 PM] 5298_
Col stole it for his meeting for his new job and I couldn't turn the notifications off so if you messaged me there would be a very loud discord notification in the middle of his very important meeting


[01/20/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[01/20/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not sure who col is but very silly idea


[01/20/2023 7:56 PM] 5298_
He's working in anti-terrorism, little does he know there's one upstairs

[01/20/2023 7:57 PM] 5298_
The message wouldn't come up but the very loud audio of a message would come up


[01/20/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao


[01/20/2023 7:57 PM] 5298_
But if the message came up he would not be allowed the job and would probably be investigated


[01/20/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

OO AA UP THE RA


[01/20/2023 8:07 PM] 5298_
There's a uniform that's hanging in what's known as father's room
A uniform so simple in its style
It's got no braid of gold or silk or no hat with feathered plume 
Yet my mother has kept it all the while 
One day she made me try it on, a wish of mine for years
"In memory of your father, dear" she said 
And when I put the Sam Browne on she was smiling through her tears
As she placed the broad black brimmer in my head 

It's just a broad black brimmer ribbons frayed and torn
By the careless whisk of many's a mountain breeze 
An old trench coat that's so battle stained and worn 
And breeches almost threadbare at the knees
A Sam Browne belt with the buckle big and strong
And a holster that's been empty many's a day
( But not for long)
But when men claim Ireland's freedom
The one who'll choose to lead them
Will wear the broad black brimmer of the IRA

It was the uniform been worn by me father long ago
When he reached me mother's homestead on the run
It was the uniform been worn in that little church below
When old Father Mac he blessed the pair as one 
After truce and treaty and the parting of the ways
He wore it when he marched up with the rest
( And the best )
And when they bore his body down that rugged heather braes 
They placed the broad black brimmer on his breast

It's just a broad black brimmer ribbons frayed and torn
By the careless whisk of many's a mountain breeze 
An old trench coat that's so battle stained and worn 
And breeches almost threadbare at the knees
A Sam Browne belt with the buckle big and strong
And a holster that's been empty many's a day
( But not for long)
But when men claim Ireland's freedom
The one who'll choose to lead them
Will wear the broad black brimmer of the IRA

[01/20/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i captured it with a glass


[01/20/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i waited patiently for a thought to strike


[01/20/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/20/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i got a chinese box and put it in there


[01/20/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then


[01/20/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i transferred it into a bottle


[01/20/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
where i brutally executed it with deodrant


[01/20/2023 9:23 PM] 5298_

Not many ways to torture people sadly


[01/21/2023 9:17 PM] 5298_
I'll just blow all their limbs off


[01/21/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good idea


[01/21/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
normally i tie them up


[01/21/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then shoot them


[01/21/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
once


[01/21/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
to cause pain


[01/21/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then burn them


[01/21/2023 9:18 PM] 5298_
Tie them up, blow their limbs off, stab them ( if you have knives, I know nothing about this game ) then burn them


[01/21/2023 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Knives are a thing


[01/21/2023 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you can make people bleed out too


[01/21/2023 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if you shoot them just right they die a slow and painful death


[01/21/2023 9:24 PM] 5298_

[01/21/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might honestly get excluded


[01/21/2023 10:15 PM] 5298_
Why's that


[01/21/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because i never go to detentions since im not aware of them


[01/21/2023 10:15 PM] 5298_
Well that's just not fair


[01/21/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know


[01/21/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I did my 2 headteachers detentions like I was supposed to because i didnt go to one afterschool on friday a week ago


[01/21/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which is fair enough


[01/21/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
at dinner time


[01/21/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but then they gave me another one for literally no reason


[01/21/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
on friday


[01/21/2023 10:16 PM] 5298_
They did that to me


[01/21/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i didnt go to that


[01/21/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and eventually theyll just exclude me


[01/21/2023 10:17 PM] 5298_
I got a headteacher detention for something I didn't do

I am not doing after school detentions


[01/21/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill do lunch time detentions if i get my food


[01/21/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but after school isnt fair no matter what


[01/21/2023 10:18 PM] 5298_
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!


[01/21/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[01/21/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Teachers and Students are both fundamental to a school's operation which is obvoius


[01/21/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
obvious


[01/21/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but to those who sit in the background, beyond the power of mr croft we are nothing but customers


[01/21/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If we strike, they arent making any money off us


[01/21/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Everyone is in on it but the teachers and students


[01/21/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They make a fortune of exploiting vulnerable children and teachers


[01/21/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and in return dont put a dime towards bettering the school but instead pocket their earnings so they can go on holiday


[01/21/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
We should get the students and try and get some teachers in on it. Be the first school in Barrow to strike. Then others can follow suit. I say we don't stop striking until the other unions in Barrow get what they want too


[01/21/2023 10:27 PM] 5298_
South Lakeland got ¬£18 million pounds but that's not what we want, we want a better country not a gift for the council

No


[01/21/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They're just accusing me of shit


[01/21/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_
What did you do? I threw a chair at a wall and I didn't get a detention


[01/21/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I don't remember doing anything


[01/21/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
They seem to do that a lot


[01/21/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If I did do something, I would remember it


[01/21/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because I would think about what could have gone differently


[01/21/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might start emailing my own propaganda to the voice email


[01/21/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
Start a forum for members of St. Bernards where we'll get the word out


[01/21/2023 10:37 PM] 5298_
Every member of St. Bernards school who wants a better barrow can walk to Abbey Road instead of school from Monday - Friday where we'll strike alongside the NHS strike. Hopefully then Chetwynd and Academy will join us and Abbey Road will be full of strikes until we get what we want


[01/21/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why does school expect isolating me in the hall from everyone else is going to fix me


[01/21/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It just makes me angrier and angrier towards the school and more likely to cause trouble


[01/21/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Is it my fault I have younger siblings and family who also need to get to school?


[01/21/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_
Well you should just wake up at 1am to get to school on time


[01/21/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I bet thats what they think


[01/21/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"oh well just get up earlier"


[01/21/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not that simple though


[01/21/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because getting up earlier 1. impacts behaviour and 2. wouldnt do shit in my situation


[01/21/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I honestly want to message the voice email and lecture them about what the fuck is wrong with school


[01/21/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and try to get a massive group of students striking


[01/21/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if the requirements are not met


[01/21/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
It's not anonymous is it?


[01/21/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nope


[01/21/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they know who it is


[01/21/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
I would join the strike immediately


[01/21/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There is no freedom in school


[01/21/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

but my best memories dont come from school


[01/21/2023 11:10 PM] 5298_
I have about 3 good memories from school


[01/21/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same


[01/21/2023 11:10 PM] 5298_
All my best memories come from time spent in nature or with my dad


[01/21/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/21/2023 11:11 PM] 5298_
And all of them are from Primary


[01/21/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They tell us that sitting playing games is fucking horrendous


[01/21/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but then make us sit for 6 hours a day


[01/21/2023 11:11 PM] 5298_
At least I'm having fun playing games


[01/21/2023 11:11 PM] 5298_
I have more good memories playing games than in school


[01/21/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/21/2023 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also schools sell our information


[01/21/2023 11:13 PM] 5298_
Who fucking doesn't


[01/21/2023 11:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik


[01/21/2023 11:13 PM] 5298_
The right to privacy is a lie


[01/21/2023 11:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But the fact the school teaches us that social media sells our data


[01/21/2023 11:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and makes it seem bad


[01/21/2023 11:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but they do it themselves


[01/21/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
We have the right but it's bypassed by things we have to sign


[01/21/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Here is a plan for if we ever strike:


[01/21/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
1. We amass the largest group possible


[01/21/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2. (optional) we get the teachers in on it


[01/21/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
3. We send a list of demands to St. Bernards


[01/21/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
4. We then go outside the school and strike


[01/21/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Eventually, other schools would probably do the same a


[01/21/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and boom


[01/21/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
domino effect


[01/21/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is probably a way of imploding the uk


[01/21/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_
We need a tax strike


[01/21/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_
Everyone refuses to pay tax until the government gives us what we want


[01/21/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_
They can't arrest us all


[01/21/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/21/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_
And they can't pay for anything in the country or for themselves without tax


[01/21/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
For schools it wouldnt exactly be about money, but about the future of people


[01/21/2023 11:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or we could go a very very violent but effective way which wouldnt be possible for us today lmfao


[01/21/2023 11:19 PM] 5298_
We have the recipe ( wink wink nudge nudge our dms are highly illegal )


[01/21/2023 11:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

and I know the chemistry


[01/21/2023 11:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/22/2023 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's supposed to be a realistic game


[01/22/2023 8:20 PM] 5298_
IT'S TOO REALISTIC


[01/22/2023 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I pulled a gun on the cult guy and the police came after me


[01/22/2023 8:22 PM] 5298_

[01/22/2023 8:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im guessing hes based off nikola tesla


[01/22/2023 8:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/22/2023 8:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik


[01/22/2023 8:56 PM] 5298_
We'd have heart attacks


[01/22/2023 8:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/22/2023 9:24 PM] 5298_
Do you want to plan the strike?


[01/22/2023 9:24 PM] 5298_
We obviously can't do it tomorrow because it's not organised


[01/22/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
Have you heard of The Pandora Effect


[01/22/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was just talking to my mum about planning one then


[01/22/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have


[01/22/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
Fucking mad


[01/22/2023 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What


[01/22/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
The Pandora Effect


[01/22/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
Not the Greek one the blue 11ft one


[01/22/2023 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theres an 11ft blue pandoras box?


[01/22/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
No


[01/22/2023 9:40 PM] 5298_
The Pandora Effect I'm on about is loads of people after watching Avatar got severe depression ( diagnosed ) because they wanted to live in Pandora so much that the real world gave them severe depression


[01/22/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[01/22/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes i have also heard of that one


[01/22/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I only found out about it not long ago


[01/22/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think that kind of applied to me because I was wondering about what planets lie beyond earth that are more beautiful like pandora but it also made me want to make a realistic planet in blender so


[01/22/2023 9:42 PM] 5298_
I still can't believe the Na'vi are 11ft tall, I haven't watched Avatar but that's terrifying


[01/22/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It makes sense to me


[01/22/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it is scary


[01/22/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if doppelgangers exist


[01/22/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
do doppelganger species exist


[01/22/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like on one planet we have humans


[01/22/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but somewhere an extragalactic planet do they also have life very very similar to humans


[01/22/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theres probably one somewhere in this galaxy


[01/22/2023 9:50 PM] 5298_
Infinity dictates there's an infinite number of us


[01/22/2023 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[01/22/2023 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So if there's an infinite universe, then there is infinite us


[01/22/2023 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because every atomic arrangement possible happens


[01/22/2023 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
an infinite number of times


[01/22/2023 9:54 PM] 5298_
But there's an infinite number of possibilities so you'd need infinity to the power of infinity for every infinite possibility to be done infinitely


[01/22/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My lymph nodes are still swollen and i noticed them about a month or 2 ago


[01/22/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They probably aren't cancer or anything serious because they are movable


[01/22/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But they feel hard and not rubbery


[01/22/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Actually 1 does feel rubbery but the other doesnt

They found life and they're double checking


[01/22/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Is there an order you're supposed to do the missions in, because I feel like if I did the robbing the O'Driscolls mission before the hunting mission I wouldn't have been able to do the hunting mission or is that not how it works. I don't want to miss anything


[01/23/2023 8:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I just throw things, It's fun


[01/23/2023 9:45 PM] 5298_
If I get handed something that isn't that valuable or fragile my immediate reaction is an overwhelming urge to lob it a wall as hard as I can


[01/23/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/23/2023 9:47 PM] 5298_

[01/23/2023 9:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I mean what is a school without students


[01/23/2023 9:48 PM] 5298_

Only if you let it be


[01/23/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
All the real adventure is gone


[01/23/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Born too late to explore the world, born too early to explore the stars


[01/23/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
It's far from gone


[01/23/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
You won't make a big discovery but that doesn't mean adventure is gone


[01/23/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
Go into the woods, find a cool tree. Hike a mountain and find a cool alcove. The big stuff is mapped but the little stuff is still out there waiting for people to find it


[01/23/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I've yet to get a car, so unless I want to travel by foot for days then I won't be doing any sort of adventuring for years


[01/23/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We're at the most boring point in human history

Any good forests in walking distances are mostly chopped down, have trainlines running through them and are full of garbage

In the Easter Holidays we'll get a bus to The Lakes and we'll make discoveries of our own and appreciate the beautiful place in which we live

While we wait for technology to reach other stars, which will last for way beyond my lifetime, I am expected to put money in the governments pockets

I've been there and it's hell for me


[01/24/2023 5:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was me and my brothers mate for the most part but at break there were loads of people


[01/24/2023 5:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I liked it because it wasnt like there was constant screaming down my ear


[01/24/2023 5:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why were you in isolation


[01/24/2023 6:05 PM] 5298_
I don't know


[01/24/2023 6:05 PM] 5298_
I was told by the hub to go to Savio to ask if I can do French in the hub and they put me in there

[01/24/2023 6:46 PM] 5298_
There was a rapist in one of the first missions in Valentine and I wasn't allowed to shoot him


[01/24/2023 6:46 PM] 5298_
I could only knock him out


[01/24/2023 6:47 PM] 5298_

[01/24/2023 8:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Whys that


[01/24/2023 8:22 PM] 5298_
I used my time out in Science today and when I left she went to Isla and told her to tell me to tell Mrs. Theaker when I'm leaving because she finds it rude. 
1. It's not rude it's a system of support and I've been told I can just leave
2. This grown ass woman is too much of a pussy to tell me I'm being rude so she has to get a 13 year old to do it for her


[01/24/2023 8:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what a knobhead


[01/24/2023 8:29 PM] 5298_
I'm going to firebomb her

[01/25/2023 8:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
People think hes welsh


[01/25/2023 8:42 PM] 5298_
He's not fucked a sheep yet so he can't be


[01/25/2023 8:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
His first horse had a welsh goddess name (i think)


[01/25/2023 8:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
morgan is a welsh name/last name


[01/25/2023 8:44 PM] 5298_
Boadicea was a queen not a goddess

I WAS BORN ON A DUBLIN STREET
WHERE THE LOYAL DRUMS DID BEAT
THOSE LOVING ENGLISH FEET
THEY WALKED ALL OVER US
AND EVERY SINGLE NIGHT
WHEN ME 'DA WOULD COME HOME TIGHT
HE'D INVITE THE NEIGHBOURS OUT WITH THIS CHORUS 
COME OUT YA BLACK AND TANS
COME OUT AND FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN
SHOW YOUR WIFE HOW YOU WON MEDALS DOWN IN FLANDERS
TELL HER HOW THE IRA MADE YOU RUN LIKE HELL AWAY FROM THE GREEN AND LOVELY LANES OF KILASHANDRA 
COME LET US HERE YOU TELL
HOW YOU SLANDERED GREAT PARNELL
WE WERE WELL AND TRULY PERSECUTED 
WHAT ARE THE SNEERS AND JEERS THAT YOU LOUDLY LET US HERE
WHEN OUT LEADERS OF SIXTEEN WERE EXECUTED 
COME OUT YA BLACK AND TANS
COME OUT AND FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN
SHOW YOUR WIFE HOW YOU WON MEDALS DOWN IN FLANDERS
TELL HER HOW THE IRA MADE YOU RUN LIKE HELL AWAY FROM THE GREEN AND LOVELY LANES OF KILASHANDRA
TELL US HOW YOU SLEW
THOSE OLD ARABS TWO BY TWO
LIKE THE ZULUS THEY HAD SPEARS AND BOW AND ARROW
HOW BRAVELY YOU FACED EACH ONE
WITH YOUR SIXTEEN POUNDER GUN 
AND YOU FRIGHTENED THEM DAMN NATIVES TO THE MARROW 
COME OUT YA BLACK AND TANS
COME OUT AND FIGHT ME LIKE MAN
SHOW YOUR WIFE HOW YOU WON MEDALS DOWN IN FLANDERS
TELL HER HOW THE IRA MADE YOU RUN LIKE HELL AWAY
FROM THE GREEN AND LOVELY LANES OF KILASHANDRA


[01/25/2023 8:58 PM] 5298_

I have a personal-ish question


[01/25/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What would that be


[01/25/2023 10:31 PM] 5298_
Have you ever had a girlfriend? I'm just curious because you just don't seem like the type


[01/25/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I went out with someone for like an hour in year 5 but I felt pressured to and that's also why i broke up with her


[01/25/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
At the moment I don't feel like I want anyone


[01/25/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just like to be on my own


[01/25/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
I don't think being pressured into an hour really counts


[01/25/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
That's what I thought, you didn't really seem like the type to seek out a relationship


[01/25/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe I will in the future but for now I don't give a shit about dating anyone


[01/25/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
And with the class of people in our school it'd be hard to find anyone that's not a cunt


[01/25/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think I'm on good terms with 99% of people in our year there's only like 2 or few that are a knobhead to me


[01/25/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Three


[01/25/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not few


[01/25/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
I'm the complete opposite, I hate 99% of our year and they hate me too


[01/25/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_
Most people think I'm going to shoot up the school


[01/25/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_
They all think I'm _very_ violent


[01/25/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_
I'm not, I've gotten better


[01/25/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
YESSSSS


[01/25/2023 10:37 PM] 5298_
I used to fucking kill people, I beat the shit out of people when I was younger. I beat people with sticks and threw bricks at them. I was so violent my mum had to put locks on the doors so when I got angry she could lock her and Danielle in the living room so I didn't hurt them


[01/25/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WERE OFF SCHOOL ON FEBRUSRY 1ST


[01/25/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I also used to be like that


[01/25/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
YEAHHHHHH


[01/25/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
I've always been like that, I still am but I can control better now. I break chairs and bins not people's limbs


[01/25/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I put a fucking hole in my brothers face once


[01/25/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He was punching me for no reason so I grabbed him threw him on the floor and kept punching his face as hard as I could and booting him


[01/25/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Then his tooth went through his upper lip


[01/25/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_

[01/25/2023 10:40 PM] 5298_
She threw me to the floor for getting mad at Danielle so I got up and pushed into a wall and beat the shit out of her


[01/25/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao go on may


[01/25/2023 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'd only beat the shit out of someone if I felt genuinely threatened


[01/25/2023 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
People always hit me and we always play fight but that's it normally


[01/25/2023 10:41 PM] 5298_
I'm not that violent anymore but if someone starts on me I will beat them until they pass out or someone drags me off


[01/25/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same


[01/25/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think I've gotten better at controlling my anger but also I can take a joke now


[01/25/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My gutter is weird and it's made like a massive bit of my wall go moldy and I'm concerned


[01/25/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
When I was like 9 this kid I had to hang out with because my step mum's friends with his mum wanted to play fight so I did and because he wanted to I thought I didn't have to hold back even though he was like 7, I kicked his leg from under him then punched him in the stomach and threw him on the floor


[01/25/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/25/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/28/2023 6:27 PM] 5298_
I love Rockstar games


[01/28/2023 6:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
GTA online tho


[01/28/2023 6:28 PM] 5298_
The way they do their open world is amazing


[01/28/2023 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2 are masterpieces


[01/28/2023 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/28/2023 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wish there was more flexibility if thats how you can describe it in missions


[01/28/2023 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like there should be a few differents path to go down in missions instead of just 1


[01/28/2023 6:29 PM] 5298_
They give you some options


[01/28/2023 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not many tho


[01/28/2023 6:29 PM] 5298_
Like wether to kill the people on the train or not


[01/28/2023 6:29 PM] 5298_
It's not big but it's an option


[01/28/2023 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
None of it really affects how the story ends


[01/28/2023 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I would like more than 2 endings


[01/28/2023 6:32 PM] 5298_
I'm going to make a very silly choice


[01/28/2023 6:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what is that


[01/28/2023 6:32 PM] 5298_
I should probably sneek in to get this oil cart but I'm going to kill everyone and run


[01/28/2023 6:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just got a book about the future of american science


[01/28/2023 6:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

OMG HE SAID THE LINE1!!1!


[01/28/2023 6:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"THE SKY IS GRAY"


[01/28/2023 6:33 PM] 5298_
It was a stupid mistake


[01/28/2023 6:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao


[01/28/2023 6:33 PM] 5298_
There was a lot more people than expected


[01/28/2023 6:33 PM] 5298_
I thought there was 8


[01/28/2023 6:33 PM] 5298_
There was 25


[01/28/2023 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i saw a video of a single brain cell trying to find a connection and it reminded me of isabel moffat


[01/28/2023 6:34 PM] 5298_
That's mean to the brain cell

I'M TRYING TO SNEAK INTO A FACTOR AND MY HORSE IS FOLLOWING ME


[01/28/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
some guy was strolling past me on his horse


[01/28/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then he started choking and fucking died


[01/28/2023 6:40 PM] 5298_
That happened to me but it was a stroke or something


[01/28/2023 6:40 PM] 5298_
He just went "deary me" and fell over dead


[01/28/2023 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Deary me


[01/28/2023 6:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he didnt say anything


[01/28/2023 6:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just died


[01/28/2023 6:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I'm robbing a bunch of inbreds


[01/28/2023 6:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good


[01/28/2023 6:55 PM] 5298_
There's a family hidden in the forest and they don't like outsiders so I'm guessing they're inbred if they don't talk to anyone else. They also speak in a weird bastardised version of English


[01/28/2023 6:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what chapter are you on now


[01/28/2023 6:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2 or 3?


[01/28/2023 6:57 PM] 5298_
2


[01/28/2023 6:57 PM] 5298_
I'm 17% in


[01/28/2023 6:59 PM] 5298_
The inbreds were loaded


[01/28/2023 6:59 PM] 5298_
I got $175


[01/28/2023 7:13 PM] 5298_
I'm giving most of my money to camp because I'm about to rob a train


[01/28/2023 7:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

you dont get much back


[01/28/2023 7:19 PM] 5298_
I don't have much use for it and I want to upgrade the camp


[01/28/2023 7:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/28/2023 7:23 PM] 5298_
I can't point the gun at the kid


[01/28/2023 7:23 PM] 5298_

with the us military and some natives


[01/28/2023 8:04 PM] 5298_
Uh oh


[01/28/2023 8:17 PM] 5298_
Am I the only one that had an emotional connection with their horse


[01/28/2023 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[01/28/2023 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I love my horse as though it's a real pet


[01/28/2023 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You know how the universe is expanding


[01/28/2023 8:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's given me a thought albeit random


[01/28/2023 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What if it's "growing" like a humaan. When it was young, it grew slowly. Now it is in it's own form of adolescence where it will grow at an increasing rate, then as it ages this rate will slow down.


[01/28/2023 8:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I found some yellowstone looking springs


[01/28/2023 8:48 PM] 5298_
It expands slower as time moves on because it's a reaction, it has potential energy and is losing it as time moves on like everything else so during the big bang it expanded at its fastest and keeps slowing


[01/28/2023 8:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dark energy


[01/28/2023 8:48 PM] 5298_
I really like my horse but it's actually a shit one but I don't want to buy a new one


[01/28/2023 8:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I found this like family farm thingy before but for some reason there were people looking for me there on guard so i raided it and killed everyone


[01/28/2023 8:50 PM] 5298_
I don't have any missions for some reason


[01/28/2023 8:51 PM] 5298_
I've got them now


[01/28/2023 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm at max honor now


[01/28/2023 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wasnt before now i am


[01/28/2023 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My honor isnt going up anymore but i keep doing things that grant honor


[01/28/2023 8:53 PM] 5298_

What's the last mission of Chapter 2?


[01/28/2023 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant remember


[01/28/2023 8:55 PM] 5298_
Because I'm about to go to Valentine with the promise of enough money to leave Horseshoe Overlook


[01/28/2023 8:56 PM] 5298_
So I'm guessing after this mission we head out west


[01/28/2023 8:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes probably


[01/28/2023 8:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Chapter 3's and 4's campsites are my favourite


[01/28/2023 8:58 PM] 5298_
Do you keep your upgrades when you move camp?


[01/28/2023 8:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm not sure


[01/28/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
I'm a dangerous outlaw


[01/28/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
I've killed hundreds


[01/28/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
Robbed multiple trains


[01/28/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
And now I'm herding fucking sheep


[01/28/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
Cornwall is going to get a bullet in the head, or 7


[01/28/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What mission are you on now


[01/28/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
We move East

I've got 7 missions left until its finished for me


[01/28/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I've just found some mad man in a river


[01/28/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i searched him up


[01/28/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and theres a theory that he became self aware


[01/28/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_
I love the little games you can play


[01/28/2023 10:22 PM] 5298_
That's terrifying


[01/28/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
I'm great at five finger filet


[01/28/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_

[01/28/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_
Even riding around is fun


[01/28/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I got will hunt playing it again


[01/28/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/28/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm literally right next to being done


[01/28/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My story may be over within an hour


[01/28/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and I await the next

How many monsters were the result of schizophrenia before people knew it was a thing?


[01/28/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/29/2023 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm on the last mission


[01/29/2023 1:30 PM] 5298_
I'm going back to my mum's today so I'm going to have to replay loads of missions


[01/29/2023 1:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
uh oh


[01/29/2023 1:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had to redo the last mission because i didnt get the ending i wanted


[01/29/2023 1:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i was up until half 3


[01/29/2023 1:34 PM] 5298_
I'm at 9% at my mum's and 23% here


[01/29/2023 2:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope GTA 6 will be as good as rdr2


[01/29/2023 2:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's been in development for 9-10 years now


[01/29/2023 2:31 PM] 5298_
They reckon it's coming out next year


[01/29/2023 2:31 PM] 5298_
And people think Red Dead Redemption 3 is coming in the 2030's which is upsetting


[01/29/2023 2:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[01/29/2023 2:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It most likely will


[01/29/2023 2:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They might be working on the very early prototypes now


[01/29/2023 2:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But they won't do much until GTA 6 comes out


[01/29/2023 2:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They'll most likely make a RDR3 immediately after but they might work on a sequel to an older series they had


[01/29/2023 2:54 PM] 5298_
Fallout 5 people are predicting


[01/29/2023 2:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fallout 5 is by bethesda


[01/29/2023 2:55 PM] 5298_
I thought they helped with it


[01/29/2023 2:55 PM] 5298_
Maybe I'm stupid


[01/29/2023 2:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I don't think so

Would you say that you had good pattern recognition and a love of puzzles?


[01/29/2023 7:21 PM] 5298_
Because I like puzzles and if you share the same sentiment I have an idea. I think if we tried together we might be able to make progress on one of the most difficult puzzles ever, that only 4 people have solved in 88 years, Cain's Jawbone


[01/29/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[01/29/2023 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cause im being stealthy with a bow and arrow


[01/29/2023 7:44 PM] 5298_
I think it would be fun to do

People always wonder what happens after death but I think a much more interesting question is what happens before life


[01/29/2023 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think theyre equally interesting


[01/29/2023 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I always wonder what came before life

Milky way galaxy


[01/29/2023 8:55 PM] 5298_
Here's a thought


[01/29/2023 8:58 PM] 5298_
If a form of God does exist then a soul would be an extension of Him and that would mean it cannot be created nor destroyed. So a soul would be its own entity that lives in some form before being infused into the body and losing any memories it had if any. It would have to lose its memories because we can't remember them but if a soul keeps its memories after death then maybe those memories are subconscious things carried over from the soul before life such as fears and wants


[01/29/2023 8:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope past lives exist


[01/29/2023 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Imagine what I might've been in a past life lmao


[01/29/2023 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope that something interesting happens after death, even if its only for 10 minutes


[01/29/2023 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'd prefer to die of natural causes than have my brain destroyed so I get to ponder life before the void takes me


[01/29/2023 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
For 10 minutes


[01/29/2023 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

What if everything had a soul, and when anything died that would transfer to another. Maybe there is an essential part to our brains that when infused with a soul creates consciousness. A star could go supernova and give it's soul to a flower and that flower wilts and gives its soul to a bison and that bison decays and gives its soul to a human and that soul is now conscious because of an essential part of out brains then the human dies and the soul loses its consciousness until it's infused to another human

The Egg


[01/29/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but


[01/29/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
with extra steps


[01/29/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
I want to do much more philosophy


[01/29/2023 9:16 PM] 5298_
I'm going to try and get some books by Camus, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and maybe Heidegger


[01/29/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe I should, but I'm not great with words and because of that I'm not great at painting an image or idea in someone's mind


[01/29/2023 9:18 PM] 5298_
You don't need to be a wordsmith you just need to get your ideas down


[01/29/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
I find writing in detail to be quite an easy process but writing something good is so much more than that. You need a great idea of which you're in no short supply


[01/29/2023 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Being a wordsmith makes it easier to get the point across


[01/29/2023 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can write in detail I think


[01/29/2023 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But for the most part whenever I put my ideas on paper they seem jumbled or rambled


[01/29/2023 9:21 PM] 5298_
I think reading makes it easier. Like a good artist looks at a lot of art a good wordsmith reads a lot of books


[01/29/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I read a lot of news articles and shit but I apart from that i dont read


[01/29/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
It's like science. You can discover something new but it becomes far easier when you do your research


[01/29/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
You should definitely read more, I read 13 books in a few months


[01/29/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I would read


[01/29/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but whenever I do, no matter how invested I am i end up zoning out


[01/29/2023 9:26 PM] 5298_
Read in short amounts. Read a few pages a day, you don't need to read multiple chapters in a day


[01/29/2023 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like art because it's easier for me to express what is going on in my mind


[01/29/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
Maybe audiobooks would work better


[01/29/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I always thought that about reading


[01/29/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like listening to stories


[01/29/2023 9:34 PM] 5298_
Spotify has an assortment of free audiobooks


[01/29/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Might give some a listen


[01/29/2023 9:36 PM] 5298_
You can get The Stranger by Camus on there


[01/29/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
If you're interested in absurdism


[01/29/2023 9:54 PM] 5298_
Sadly, it's going to be a shit day on Wednesday


[01/29/2023 9:55 PM] 5298_
I think I might try and find those books tomorrow and I can spend Wednesday reading them


[01/29/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why is it going to be shit


[01/29/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also I think my ears infected


[01/29/2023 10:00 PM] 5298_
rain all day


[01/29/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[01/29/2023 10:03 PM] 5298_
I know that Waterstones has The Outsider by Camus in stock but they don't have any by Nietzsche, Kierkegaard or Heidegger


[01/29/2023 10:04 PM] 5298_
I'll have a look at what I can find


[01/29/2023 10:37 PM] 5298_
Maybe it could be possible to unlock the history of the soul via a further understanding of the brain


[01/30/2023 4:35 PM] 5298_
I'm at Waterstones and I've found loads of Nietzsche some Camus and Kierkegaard


[01/30/2023 4:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Watery Stones


[01/30/2023 4:44 PM] 5298_
I spent too much money in there


[01/30/2023 5:28 PM] 5298_
Fifty five ""great"" British pounds


[01/30/2023 5:55 PM] 5298_
GGGQEP


[01/30/2023 5:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What does that mean


[01/30/2023 5:58 PM] 5298_
Really fucking good computer


[01/30/2023 6:00 PM] 5298_
GGG is a type of synthetic metal that is perfect for data storage, a small processor made of GGG is enough to hold 8 internet's and QEP is a quantum processor that processes information instantly so a GGGQEP is a computer that can process all date in the world instantly


[01/30/2023 6:00 PM] 5298_
It doesn't exist as you can imagine

the british army is falling rapidly


[01/30/2023 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in terms of strength


[01/30/2023 9:00 PM] 5298_
WOOOOOOHOOOOOOO


[01/30/2023 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The US no longer considers them an "elite fighting force"


[01/30/2023 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and says they are no longer able to defend themselves or their allies


[01/30/2023 9:00 PM] 5298_
That's the US though, England has trashed them multiple times


[01/30/2023 9:01 PM] 5298_
The US spends the most money and has the biggest army but they have never won a war without allied help


[01/30/2023 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Even the defense secretary admits it


[01/30/2023 9:02 PM] 5298_
America's failures aside, WOOOOHOOOOO


[01/30/2023 9:03 PM] 5298_
THE TIME IS COMING FAST
AND I THINK THEM DAYS ARE NEAR
WHEN EACH ENGLISHMEN HE'LL RUN BEFORE US 
AND IF THERE BE A NEED 
THEN OUR KIDS WILL SING GOD SPEED 
WITH A VERSE OR TWO OF THIS FINE CHORUS


[01/30/2023 9:07 PM] 5298_
You know the fight today


[01/30/2023 9:09 PM] 5298_
Mrs. Wood stood there and watched everything until the guy was knocked out. This school is fucked


[01/30/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[01/30/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mrs wood sigma female


[01/30/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
She literally watched the whole fight


[01/30/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
Burn the ship


[01/30/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
We have the perfect reason to strike


[01/30/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
Who's going to disagree with hating teachers for watching and gossiping about rights instead of helping the students

[01/31/2023 7:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mrs skelton sent me out because she said i was messing (i wasnt)


[01/31/2023 7:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then she left me out there for like 20 minutes


[01/31/2023 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
came out and i told her that theres no point because 1 im not learning anything and 2 the only artistic freedom we get in that room is colouring shit in


[01/31/2023 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and refused to go back in


[01/31/2023 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
for ages


[01/31/2023 7:08 PM] 5298_
Same, Mario, same


[01/31/2023 7:25 PM] 5298_
What was it you said in Science


[01/31/2023 7:25 PM] 5298_
Something about God being a force of some nature


[01/31/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[01/31/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it wasnt that


[01/31/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont remember


[01/31/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what it was but i know it wasnt that


[01/31/2023 7:32 PM] 5298_
I'm trying to remember it because it was great


[01/31/2023 7:32 PM] 5298_
It gave me an epiphany


[01/31/2023 7:39 PM] 5298_
So you know my theory about souls and there's a multitude of them that can be passed on through death in a weird version of reincarnation. What if that group of souls _is_ the unmoved mover


[01/31/2023 7:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What if


[01/31/2023 7:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was talking about unconsciousness


[01/31/2023 7:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it came back to me


[01/31/2023 7:40 PM] 5298_
Oh yeah, what if God is unconsciousness


[01/31/2023 7:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think it was about how unconsciousness is infintie


[01/31/2023 7:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
infinite


[01/31/2023 7:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what it was


[01/31/2023 7:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In terms of before and after life


[01/31/2023 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i find it hard to comprehend the infinite regression of time before birth


[01/31/2023 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I understand after birth


[01/31/2023 7:43 PM] 5298_
Infinity is a number, and like any number it can be made bigger. That seems impossible but it's not for some reason. I hate to think about it but you can technically have infinity¬≤ or infinity to the power of infinity because it's a number


[01/31/2023 7:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate it


[01/31/2023 7:45 PM] 5298_

Strange times were living in 
Panic and hysteria
Poor man learn the rich man don't care for ya 
Narcissist mindset spread like malaria 
Sit back and watch the show 
America 
Britain split
Through fickle shit
A government
Of hypocrites
These counterfeit
Politicians sit 
In parliament
Not adequate
Needlessly bleeding resources all dry
Turn a blind eye if it means a pay rise 
Oh what a shame it would be I would die
If Number Ten Downing Street burned in a fire 
Only joking 
Only messing 
Don't be stressing 
I'm a peaceful adolescent
There's no need to be unpleasant
Write me thesis in a rhyme scheme 
To analyse the brain
While my fingers on the trigger 
Of a Money Game

[01/31/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
You know he lives in hotels across the country


[01/31/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
Guess who else did that


[01/31/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[01/31/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Who


[01/31/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
None other than a Sir. James Savile


[01/31/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Paul Savile


[01/31/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
He is a pedophile


[01/31/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
I'm convinced


[01/31/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also not a "sir" anymore


[01/31/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he got his knighthood removed


[01/31/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
True, he is dead too


[01/31/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
You lose your knighthood upon death


[01/31/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
I'm surprised Andrew let his knighthood be revoked


[01/31/2023 9:15 PM] 5298_

Do you think influencers should follow the rule of position of trust


[01/31/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
With younger audience members


[01/31/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
Like 16-20


[01/31/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
I think they should, younger audience members do see them as an idol and someone they can wholeheartedly trust


[01/31/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
They shouldn't and it's retarded but they do


[01/31/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
I hate the way sexual assault is viewed in this country


[01/31/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
It disgusting


[01/31/2023 9:28 PM] 5298_
The age of consent needs to be heightened


[01/31/2023 9:28 PM] 5298_
16 is far too low


[01/31/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Age of consent isnt just for sexual interactions tho


[01/31/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It just be higher for sexual interactions, but everything else seems okay


[01/31/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wait


[01/31/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nvm it is


[01/31/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah should be raised then


[01/31/2023 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they taught me differently at school, that the age of consent was for loads of things


[01/31/2023 9:40 PM] 5298_
It makes no sense that you can have sex with grown adults before you are legally able to drive a car, drink, smoke or enter a club


[01/31/2023 9:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When you reach the age of consent its still illegal to have sex with grown adults iirc


[01/31/2023 9:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when you reach that age its for people who are also your age


[01/31/2023 9:40 PM] 5298_
IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE RULES YOU CAN HAVE SEX BEFORE YOU CAN PLAY RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2


[01/31/2023 9:41 PM] 5298_
THAT'S SO RETARDED


[01/31/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah but you arent gonna get fucking arrested for playing red dead


[01/31/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its illegal, but its a law they dont seem to act on


[01/31/2023 9:41 PM] 5298_
It's a guideline


[01/31/2023 9:41 PM] 5298_
Not a law


[01/31/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A guideline


[01/31/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not even a law


[01/31/2023 9:41 PM] 5298_
But still, if you follow the guidelines


[01/31/2023 9:41 PM] 5298_

[01/31/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Even tho i wouldve died of disease


[01/31/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or something


[01/31/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i wouldve loved to be a cowboy and just piss about in the desert all day


[01/31/2023 9:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I finished Red Dead Redemption 2 fully, there's an epilogue you have to beat


[01/31/2023 9:44 PM] 5298_
No spoilers


[01/31/2023 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Absolutely not


[01/31/2023 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why would i spoil this fucking awesome journey for you?


[01/31/2023 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats just a knobhead move


[01/31/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had the main bits of the game spoiled for me by youtube recommendations, so i never got to blind play the game which felt awful


[01/31/2023 9:45 PM] 5298_
It is, but sometimes people just get carried away and gush about things they like without thinking


[01/31/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im trying to keep it vague


[01/31/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was thinking about what to say because I knew its something that I could end up spoiling accidentally


[01/31/2023 9:46 PM] 5298_
I've seen the bad ending but I don't have any context to what it means I've just seen a cut scene with no audio


[01/31/2023 9:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[01/31/2023 9:46 PM] 5298_
I'm guessing it's the bad ending because from what I remember it's Arthur freezing to death on a mountain


[01/31/2023 9:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dont find the context


[01/31/2023 9:47 PM] 5298_
I don't want to


[01/31/2023 9:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Itll ruin the whole game for you in terms of knowing what happens


[01/31/2023 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The closing credits are half an hour long and im watching most of them because I feel like its the right thing to do for some reason


[01/31/2023 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might write a very very short story


[01/31/2023 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like only a few paragraphs


[01/31/2023 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cause im bored as fuck


[01/31/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_
I might do some writing


[01/31/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
Can you give me an abstract noun?


[01/31/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fear


[01/31/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
A motif?


[01/31/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Hmm

Hearing footsteps in a large abandoned house


[01/31/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
Specific


[01/31/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It would strike fear into a normal person


[01/31/2023 10:40 PM] 5298_
True, but I was thinking more abstract or less specific to try and create a scene


[01/31/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[01/31/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just go with footsteps then


[01/31/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
Thank you


[01/31/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Listen to Outlaws From The West from the rdr2 soundtrack


[01/31/2023 11:11 PM] 5298_
Game OST's are so good, better than most music


[01/31/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Normally


[01/31/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The red dead 2 ost is fucking awesome


[01/31/2023 11:13 PM] 5298_
Outer Wilds happens 500 million years in the future


[01/31/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Well i didnt know that


[01/31/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
did you beat that game


[01/31/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
No, on the OST there's a song called 14.3 billion years so I'm guessing it happens 500 million years in the future


[01/31/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No it doesnt


[01/31/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Can i spoil something for you


[01/31/2023 11:15 PM] 5298_
Sure


[01/31/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its about the end


[01/31/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It explains that songs title


[01/31/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If you still want me to spoil it


[01/31/2023 11:16 PM] 5298_
Yeah, it's fine I'm not that invested


[01/31/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Basically, the 14.3 billion years is how long it takes for the new universe to form at the end of the game

Tall trees slice the little slight glimpses of sunlight like rationed bread. Vast deserts of virgin snow stretch past infinity in every direction. It suffocates all life under it. The blizzard's cold air freezes my breath and stings my lungs until they turn opiate and numb. I trudge forward, only the wind and the crunching snow to listen to. I move because I fear what will happen if I stop; fear the pointlessness of walking this far just to turn back. No, I keep going

I ruth the trees, their only hope for warmth being self-immolation. I assemble their discarded limbs into a heap ready for praise to Prometheus. I take the thick glove off to get the match; when it is stolen by Hel's tempest. My exposed hand quickly numbs and loses most of its movement. Fire is my only hope. Sparks fly and the match is lit, but as quick as Minas, it is blown out.

The day dies. I can't move any further. Laying with my defeat, I stare at the billion brilliant burning stars. I think of their warmth. I fear what will happen next. Cold seeps into my marrow. I am become cold itself. In the foggy distance, I see a horse as white as the snow, with a familiar rider. He has come to take me now


[01/31/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was writing my little short story


[01/31/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania


[02/01/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The harsh sun bled it‚Äôs final rays over the distant ember hills. The dusty air scratched at my raw, hoarse throat as it rolled through the flat, barren plain. The uncomfortable and coarse sand crunched with any slight movement, as it built itself around me as though leaves on a windy autumn day. The hot, desert sun dropped beneath the horizon, dragging night with it. My dying fire glowed dimly in the distance, as I felt death glaring at me. My time was up. My hand was maroon with blood and my white shirt stained as my life slipped away through the craters in my stomach. They laughed at me, reminding me of the encounter with my rival. A wave of peace rushed over me, it was as warm as the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. I embraced my end and my vision began to blur and distort as I felt myself being dragged away. My limbs were paralysed by the weight that fate was bearing down on me. Any attempts at breathing were futile, as my body grew too weak. I took one last deep breathe. The stars finally faded. What was once one of the most wanted men in the west was now a lonely corpse under the dark blanket of the night.


[02/01/2023 12:29 AM] 5298_

[02/01/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not even the most habitable of planets either


[02/01/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they arent


[02/01/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i meant


[02/01/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not its


[02/01/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its TRAPPIST-1B and TRAPPIST-1G


[02/01/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Trappist 1B is believed to be like venus


[02/01/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/01/2023 12:37 AM] 5298_
Well, the most habitable planet is Earth


[02/01/2023 12:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that we know of*


[02/01/2023 12:37 AM] 5298_
Because they use a scale based on Earth, so Earth is 1


[02/01/2023 12:38 AM] 5298_
If we found a planet twice as habitable as Earth it would be 2 and one that's half would be 0.5


[02/01/2023 12:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If we found a planet twice as habitable as earth it wouldnt be as earth like


[02/01/2023 12:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats the earth similarity index


[02/01/2023 12:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but the esi has no relation to habitablity


[02/01/2023 12:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/01/2023 12:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If a person lived a healthy life and life expectancy was increasing at least a year per year, unless something like a stroke or something manages to kill them off theyre going to live for a long fucking time

[02/01/2023 4:12 PM] 5298_
A bookie but the odds at 6-4


[02/01/2023 4:13 PM] 5298_
It's for the end of February


[02/01/2023 4:13 PM] 5298_
It'll be fine, some snow won't hurt


[02/01/2023 4:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
MetOffice are calling for average to above average temperatures


[02/01/2023 4:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I put the odds very low, especially since its the daily star trying to clickbait


[02/01/2023 4:14 PM] 5298_
Very true


[02/01/2023 4:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think we're nearing a point where games can't look anymore realistic


[02/01/2023 4:27 PM] 5298_
I think that's good


[02/01/2023 4:27 PM] 5298_
But I also think games don't need to look realistic to look good


[02/01/2023 4:28 PM] 5298_
I was playing the new MW2 game and I genuinely forgot it was a game and not an interactive movie


[02/01/2023 4:28 PM] 5298_

If we made faster-than-light travel, then what is the upper bound on how fast we can go


[02/01/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If the universe is infinite, with infinite objects


[02/01/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then the events of red dead redemption happened somewhere down to the tiniest of details


[02/01/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
I have an experiment that is probably illegal and entirely immoral but it could completely revolutionise science and spirituality and the human understanding of the universe


[02/01/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
I might be bigging it up a little but depending on the findings, we could start to have a beginning to some of our biggest questions


[02/02/2023 12:35 AM] 5298_
Kill loads of living things and weigh them as they die and see if there is a consistent weight loss with everything that dies then we can confidentially predict that a soul exists


[02/02/2023 12:36 AM] 5298_
Very illegal, very immoral, very interesting


[02/02/2023 3:17 PM] 5298_
I was very tempted to take my mask off in English and see how you'd react


[02/02/2023 5:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Reece said Mrs theaker left


[02/02/2023 7:00 PM] 5298_
YEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH


[02/02/2023 7:02 PM] 5298_
I just woke up from a ""nap"" and I had a dream about us two fucking around in school


[02/02/2023 7:02 PM] 5298_
It was weird though


[02/02/2023 7:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What were we doing


[02/02/2023 7:02 PM] 5298_
Just not listening to teachers and laughing when they asked us questions and you said a slur


[02/02/2023 7:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[02/02/2023 7:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Of course i did


[02/02/2023 7:04 PM] 5298_
Miss asked you a question and you went "I don't know. I know what I can't say. I can't say big black ni*gers"

[02/02/2023 7:06 PM] 5298_
Give me a minute to fully explain, my mum is shouting at me


[02/02/2023 7:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In my dream the other night i was in kells then i realised i was dreaming so i went up to miss speirs and started chanting up the ra


[02/02/2023 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because I wanted to prove it was a dream and she just ignored me


[02/02/2023 7:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had a dream the other night where I was in this weird giant room made out of like invisible clingfilm and I was in orbit round earth with some tour guide and someone else


[02/02/2023 7:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

There was torrential rain and the biggest flood England had seen in centuries. The flood was breaking down doors and cracking windows. Then an infomercial came up on my TV that was talking about the dangers of the flood, then it switched to an advert for an upcoming Alien themed game show filmed at our school. I pointed out that the set was my school to Col and then suddenly we were in my school yard where the camera was in the advert and Col was there and so was the seatee. Then I was in the Hub and Mr. Weelan asked me to get the register from Revo because he hadn't marked me in. I went upstairs in Revo and found a sparkly pink book that must be the register, I pick it up and suddenly I'm in the downstairs hallway of Revo with my maths class all stood up getting a presentation from a new teacher and a new teaching assistant and they were using the TV for their PowerPoint. It was about religion or something and why the teacher was Christian and didn't follow specifically Ancient Greek Mythology - for some reason - and on the board was Hades with a cross through it and Hell and God with a tick through it and I said to you that "Technically you can have those two with Hades because in some passages in the Bible they call Hell Hades" to which you replied "what?" And laughed. The TA came up to us and asked my "Bethany, what do you think?" to which I broke down laughing to the point of tears and so did you, I corrected her to Dylan but she kept calling me Bethany, then she asked you what you think and you said "I don't know. I know what I can't say. I can't say big black ni*gers"


[02/02/2023 7:19 PM] 5298_
That was my dream


[02/02/2023 7:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[02/02/2023 7:22 PM] 5298_
It was weird


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] 5298_
Do you have a favourite dream?


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
All my dreams are awesome in their own way


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i remember one that was my favourite for a while


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
this was years ago


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It all begins on planet Earth


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
obviously


[02/02/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I went to the zoo with my family


[02/02/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i looked up, and noticed a bright light


[02/02/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it wasnt massive like the sun


[02/02/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was just there


[02/02/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/02/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
This dream takes place over weeks


[02/02/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont remember exactly what happened


[02/02/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But i think on the news they were talking about a blackhole getting nearer to earth and the end was nigh and all that


[02/02/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so over these weeks, the world prepared for its end


[02/02/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dreamt about his because i saw a trailer for a film


[02/02/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which has a similar idea to it


[02/02/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But it became clear that time was slowing down and gravity felt weaker


[02/02/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats the bit i remember until


[02/02/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the blackhole was very close to earth


[02/02/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it just so happened to land in barrow


[02/02/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i didnt understand how they worked may


[02/02/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then


[02/02/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was suddenly right next to me


[02/02/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the blackhole stared me right in the face


[02/02/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then it skipped to a third person view of me


[02/02/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
running away from this beast


[02/02/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the winds were so strong, and there was purple dust from everything being destroyed lmfao


[02/02/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i had to parkour over chunks of walls being sucked in


[02/02/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i escaped


[02/02/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but the others didnt


[02/02/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and thats all i remember


[02/02/2023 7:29 PM] 5298_
I can't turn my notifications off for some reason and it's driving me insane


[02/02/2023 7:32 PM] 5298_
I remember one of my earliest dreams


[02/02/2023 7:32 PM] 5298_
It was my first nightmare


[02/02/2023 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I remember a dream from 2012


[02/02/2023 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i know the date because i was on holiday when it happened


[02/02/2023 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i know the date of that holiday


[02/02/2023 7:33 PM] 5298_
I was in a white abyss being chased by a monster


[02/02/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was being eaten alive by giant ants probably the size of rats and i was watching it from my brothers perspective


[02/02/2023 7:34 PM] 5298_
Is Finley your brother?


[02/02/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[02/02/2023 7:34 PM] 5298_
HOW


[02/02/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Finley O'Neill is not my brother


[02/02/2023 7:34 PM] 5298_
HE HAS THE EXACT SAME LAST NAME


[02/02/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe he is related to me though


[02/02/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/02/2023 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I guarantee that there is some form of relation to him


[02/02/2023 7:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/02/2023 7:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/02/2023 8:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/02/2023 10:05 PM] 5298_
I'm shocked


[02/02/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[02/02/2023 10:05 PM] 5298_
It took Exurb1a 9:03 minutes to swear in his Buddhism video


[02/02/2023 10:05 PM] 5298_
That's impressive for him


[02/02/2023 10:06 PM] 5298_
I didn't play Red Dead today


[02/02/2023 10:10 PM] 5298_

The world is good. Humanity is good. We are indefatigable, we are indomitable. No matter the strife, plague, famine, bickering or injustice we face we make it through. We trip over a stone and we discover gravity, we shout and we invent a million beautiful languages to express a million beautiful emotions a million times over in a million different ways. We invented a million. I challenge you to look and find something we didn't invent, and when you do remember that the name for that was invented by mankind. We are unstoppable. We see great, horrible things and we invent wonderful stories about them. In a world full of unknowable things we invent beauty and wonder. We are good. The world is good

I was listening to music and the line "Like constellations, a million years away" made me think that we discovered things so far away we have to measure them in time, and we discovered time, and how to count it, and we discovered numbers and all of these thousands of years of discovery and invention all possible for me to be sat in a warm building, listening to words recorded years ago on a computer powerful enough to send a man to the moon ( which we fucking did ), and those words on this impossible machine are so wonderful and so complicated because of all that time which it took for it to even be possible for them to be write

[02/04/2023 1:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Agreed


[02/04/2023 1:09 AM] 5298_
I can't believe that thing is alive


[02/04/2023 1:09 AM] 5298_
Well, was alive


[02/04/2023 1:10 AM] 5298_
In that picture, that's somehow not a corpse


[02/04/2023 1:10 AM] 5298_
Souls must exist, there has to be some metaphysical aspect to that because there is no way that thing could be alive without some paranormal intervention


[02/04/2023 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[02/04/2023 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/04/2023 2:27 PM] 5298_

[02/04/2023 2:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/04/2023 2:27 PM] 5298_
I got home from school and slept for hours until like ten pm


[02/04/2023 2:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont blame you


[02/04/2023 2:27 PM] 5298_
So I wasn't having tea


[02/04/2023 2:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Sometimes when I get back from school i lie in bed for a bit because im bored and just play on my phone but i normally end up falling asleep for an hour


[02/04/2023 2:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it always feels weird


[02/04/2023 2:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and sometimes when i fall asleep that way it feels like the whole world is getting further away and im getting sucked into unconsciousness


[02/04/2023 2:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its a strange feel


[02/04/2023 2:29 PM] 5298_
I'm not going to be doing that many missions today


[02/04/2023 2:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
even then it happens sometimes when im going to sleep normally


[02/04/2023 2:29 PM] 5298_
There's two things I want to do first


[02/04/2023 2:29 PM] 5298_
1) Solve the murder mystery
2) hunt all of the rare animals


[02/04/2023 2:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it feels like theres about 3 layers to the world and when i close my eyes i can see whats going on outside of it but the layers become separated


[02/04/2023 2:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I need to solve the murder mystery and stuff


[02/04/2023 2:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/04/2023 4:39 PM] 5298_
It feels like a bad omen that as I'm riding to catch a killer, a thunderstorm starts


[02/04/2023 4:43 PM] 5298_
I SHOT A WOMAN'S HEAD OFF AND SHE DID A BACKFLIP


[02/04/2023 4:50 PM] 5298_

The summer holidays will be nice but I hate summer itself


[02/04/2023 6:50 PM] 5298_
It's far too hot


[02/04/2023 6:51 PM] 5298_
That's why I like spring, it's the right temperature for me


[02/04/2023 6:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Even thought its far too hot, i find it more enjoyable the winter and autumn


[02/04/2023 6:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Spring is just as good though


[02/04/2023 6:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
actually


[02/04/2023 6:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
slightly worse because shorter days


[02/04/2023 6:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and its more the late end of the middle of spring


[02/04/2023 6:51 PM] 5298_

It's one for me and my friend, I made it because I didn't want to see the name Dylan every time I talked to her so I made that so I could nickname myself May. That's why I would blur out the names when I sent you screenshots

I need to learn how the king works


[02/04/2023 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think thats the missed win bit


[02/04/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If I had moved my bishop to f2 that wouldve been checkmate


[02/04/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
You couldn't have though


[02/04/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
You would have had to love your pawn and I would have moved my king


[02/04/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats what the analysis said at least


[02/04/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Actually


[02/04/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
might not have


[02/04/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was looking and it showed me that f2 wouldve been the best


[02/05/2023 12:00 AM] 5298_
I can't tell if you're really good or if I'm really shit


[02/05/2023 12:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think we're both shit

I'M SO RETARDED


[02/05/2023 12:02 AM] 5298_
I FUCKING HATE THE KING


[02/05/2023 12:03 AM] 5298_
IT MAKES NO SENSE


[02/05/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It makes lots of sense


[02/05/2023 12:03 AM] 5298_
How


[02/05/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Figure it out


[02/05/2023 12:03 AM] 5298_
I'm trying


[02/05/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its very simple


[02/05/2023 12:03 AM] 5298_
It's fucking not


[02/05/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
I can move one anywhere around me except sometimes I can't for some reason and I can't take anything


[02/05/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
And nothing can take me


[02/05/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
I don't get it


[02/05/2023 12:06 AM] 5298_
How does a king work


[02/05/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I still dont understand checkmate stalemate etc


[02/05/2023 12:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You can move 1 block but you cant move anywhere where you can be threatened


[02/05/2023 12:07 AM] 5298_
Stalemate means nothings happening, we're just going to keep going around in a loop until time


[02/05/2023 12:07 AM] 5298_
So how do you win then?


[02/05/2023 12:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
SHIT I JUST REALISED WHAT CHECKMATE IS


[02/05/2023 12:07 AM] 5298_
If you can't take a king how do you win?


[02/05/2023 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What do you mean


[02/05/2023 12:08 AM] 5298_
Well, the king will never move somewhere where it could be taken, so how do you win if you can't take all the opponents pieces?


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel confused


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
Exactly


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
The king makes no sense


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont understand what youre saying


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
I understand the moves


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You can only attack if the person moves a piece next to you


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
You can't capture a king


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
You physically can't move a king into a position where it will be captured


[02/05/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
So how do you win?


[02/05/2023 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So if you were able to move somewhere where you could be captured, it would go against the games rules


[02/05/2023 12:10 AM] 5298_
If you can't take your opponent's king, how do you win chess?


[02/05/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You put a piece next to the king which is also in your threaten radius and therefore it can not move meaning you win


[02/05/2023 12:11 AM] 5298_
So you demobilise the king


[02/05/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[02/05/2023 12:11 AM] 5298_
I get it now


[02/05/2023 12:14 AM] 5298_
I was on a killing spree


[02/05/2023 12:16 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fucks sake


[02/05/2023 12:16 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sometimes when im dragging shit it puts it down


[02/05/2023 12:16 AM] 5298_
That happens to me too


[02/05/2023 12:16 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was gonna put the queen somewhere else but oh well


[02/05/2023 12:17 AM] 5298_
YOU COCK


[02/05/2023 12:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought that was a noble sacrifice from your part


[02/05/2023 12:19 AM] 5298_
I did get rid of your killing machine but it was at the cost of my king


[02/05/2023 12:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Queen


[02/05/2023 12:19 AM] 5298_
I keep getting that wrong


[02/05/2023 12:20 AM] 5298_
It's because the King piece is the crown and I associate the crown with the Queen


[02/05/2023 12:23 AM] 5298_
Fuck


[02/05/2023 12:23 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I hope demons are disemboweling H√°n Xin for all of eternity and crowning him with a burning crown of thorns that make his blood so hot it burns his skin as it runs down his face


[02/05/2023 12:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Rematch


[02/05/2023 12:41 AM] 5298_
The things I would do to H√°n Xin would make the devil himself shudder


[02/05/2023 12:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Bit close


[02/05/2023 12:52 AM] 5298_

[02/05/2023 1:07 AM] 5298_
Because your queen would take my king and leave my queen defenceless


[02/05/2023 1:07 AM] 5298_
But in the first one my queen takes your king and we can both move


[02/05/2023 1:07 AM] 5298_
It's limited movement but it's still movement


[02/05/2023 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It said black wins but it also said I won


[02/05/2023 1:09 AM] 5298_
No clue


[02/05/2023 1:10 AM] 5298_
MAYUPTHERA WON BY CHECKMATE


[02/05/2023 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
On the analysis it gives you white pawns and me black pawns

[02/05/2023 1:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That explains it


[02/05/2023 1:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But that also doesnt make sense because my king could still retreat


[02/05/2023 1:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/05/2023 1:17 AM] 5298_
I'm silly


[02/05/2023 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Does a checkmate involve the king and queen


[02/05/2023 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wait


[02/05/2023 1:20 AM] 5298_
Not sure


[02/05/2023 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because that should've been one


[02/05/2023 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or


[02/05/2023 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe if there is a piece that can destroy the threat then it isnt one


[02/05/2023 1:21 AM] 5298_
Yeah I think that it


[02/05/2023 1:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just figured that out


[02/05/2023 1:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is handy to know


[02/05/2023 1:22 AM] 5298_
FUCK

[02/05/2023 1:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How the fuck was that not a checkmate


[02/05/2023 1:24 AM] 5298_

[02/05/2023 1:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wait


[02/05/2023 1:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know immediately


[02/05/2023 1:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I shouldve brought my king along


[02/05/2023 1:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im a fucking retard


[02/05/2023 1:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ill do one more match then im getting off cause im getting really tired


[02/05/2023 1:25 AM] 5298_
But, it's impossible for a king and a king to capture each other so that's why it's a draw when we each only have a king


[02/05/2023 1:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ik


[02/05/2023 1:32 AM] 5298_
Fuck sake


[02/05/2023 1:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Two hours of chess is surprisingly tiring

Isn't it weird that different generations find a new poison that they use in everything

[02/05/2023 1:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like making a random country overpowered as shit


[02/05/2023 1:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I gave germany all the tech up to ww2 and shit and i blitzkrieged the austrians


[02/05/2023 2:15 PM] 5298_
Isn't it weird that most religions idea of suffering is the same as their current condition?


[02/05/2023 2:18 PM] 5298_
Like, the Abrahamic religions from the deserts of the middle east have Hell which is a place perpetually on fire. Norse mythology in the arctic circle of Scandinavia have Hel which is a frozen waste land. Buddhists just have reincarnation which is literally the same condition again. Greek mythology is weird with their afterlife and it would take too long to explain but it's basically the same as Greece


[02/05/2023 2:19 PM] 5298_
Humans hate their own condition


[02/05/2023 2:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Look at how much of the board i controlled

I wish you could make the board look better


[02/05/2023 3:07 PM] 5298_
Like, the more games you win you can unlock things to make the board or pieces look nice


[02/05/2023 3:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You can change the board


[02/05/2023 3:08 PM] 5298_
How?


[02/05/2023 3:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
On the settings icon


[02/05/2023 3:08 PM] 5298_
I figured it out


[02/05/2023 3:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I set you a new challenge

30 minutes?


[02/05/2023 3:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[02/05/2023 3:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cba with time


[02/05/2023 3:09 PM] 5298_
It's the only chance I have to win

[02/05/2023 3:44 PM] 5298_
If you had your king it would have been checkmate


[02/05/2023 3:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[02/05/2023 3:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I literally only had to move it to that tile

[02/05/2023 3:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its always a stalemate


[02/05/2023 3:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its pissing me off


[02/05/2023 3:45 PM] 5298_
Yes, if your king is next to your queen then it would have been checkmate because I couldn't have moved anywhere, my only move there was capturing your queen but if your king was there I couldn't have done that


[02/05/2023 3:45 PM] 5298_
I understand the game I'm just shit


[02/05/2023 3:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[02/05/2023 3:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its still pissing me off though

I'm going to play red dead now


[02/05/2023 3:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/05/2023 5:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'd say it's not even really a stereotype


[02/05/2023 5:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In that game at least


[02/05/2023 5:43 PM] 5298_
I raced Dutch back and the cut scene made it seem like it was close but he was miles back


[02/05/2023 5:55 PM] 5298_

[02/05/2023 6:16 PM] 5298_
I've done a lot today on Red Dead


[02/05/2023 6:16 PM] 5298_

You can play chess again AI


[02/05/2023 6:43 PM] 5298_
I wonder when game developers will use powerful AI as NPC's in games to make them more realistic


[02/05/2023 6:43 PM] 5298_
That would be terrifying


[02/05/2023 6:43 PM] 5298_
Imagine playing red dead and holding a gun to an npc and a real sentient thing starts begging for it's actual life


[02/05/2023 6:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lovely


[02/05/2023 6:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/05/2023 8:12 PM] 5298_
I've done the big hit on the bank which got us _a lot_ of money and now we're preparing to rob the Grays and Braithwates which will hopefully give us enough gold to buy the fucking west


[02/05/2023 8:13 PM] 5298_
Is St Denis out west?


[02/05/2023 8:33 PM] 5298_

How


[02/05/2023 8:33 PM] 5298_
I'm in a cutscene but I can't hear anyone talking, the music is playing and their mouths are moving but I can't hear the conversation


[02/05/2023 8:34 PM] 5298_
I'm out the cutscene and it's working now


[02/05/2023 8:38 PM] 5298_

This mission is so shit

It's a stealth mission with a bigillion guards and when I get caught I have to start all the way at the beginning instead of at the fields I'm at

I had to leave quickly


[02/05/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[02/05/2023 10:14 PM] 5298_
My mum came upstairs and I'm ""sleeping""


[02/05/2023 10:17 PM] 5298_
I've realised something


[02/05/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[02/05/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What have you realised


[02/05/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
I used to hate things that didn't follow strict rules of ""reality"" I guess you'd call it


[02/05/2023 10:20 PM] 5298_
I hated bad grammar, abstract art, music without lyrics, anything that wasn't founded directly within the norm of expression I hated


[02/05/2023 10:20 PM] 5298_
But now I much prefer expressionism


[02/05/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_
Language and art and music and all other things are ways of expression and should do such, they shouldn't follow rules because our souls don't follow rules


[02/05/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_
So how could you express a ruleless thing with limitations?


[02/05/2023 11:39 PM] 5298_
moc.ssehC


[02/05/2023 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

The other side


[02/05/2023 11:58 PM] 5298_

[02/06/2023 12:06 AM] 5298_
I could have won


[02/06/2023 12:07 AM] 5298_

[02/06/2023 12:10 AM] 5298_

May i think theres some truth to visitation dreams


[02/06/2023 9:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive been thinking about it for a bit


[02/06/2023 9:48 PM] 5298_
I think there is a plausible other explanation but I think so too


[02/06/2023 9:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think theres multiple explanations and theres multiple types of them


[02/06/2023 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But, my nana had a dream that is fucking weird. Basically, she had a dream where she was saying goodbye to her friend at a bus stop. She got on the bus and it was like she was never going to see her again because all her stuff was packed. So, the next morning, this reminded her that she hadn't spoken to her friend in a while, and she decided to call her. When she picked up the phone, she received the news that her friend had passed away a few weeks beforehand.


[02/06/2023 9:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She had no clue about her passing, and I'm pretty sure she had no clue about any conditions she was suffering from since it had been such a long time since they last spoke


[02/06/2023 9:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think thats fucking crazy


[02/06/2023 9:51 PM] 5298_
Souls have to exist


[02/06/2023 9:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My mam also had a dream where she saw my nana who had passed away not long before in a bar, wearing a mint green dress. I don't think she had ever wore this dress, but she told my nana, her daughter, the next day about it and she said thats the colour of the dress she chose for her to be buried in


[02/06/2023 9:54 PM] 5298_
They have to have some merit


[02/06/2023 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly


[02/06/2023 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ever since my uncle died theres been too many coincidences and shit and it makes me think there is something


[02/06/2023 9:56 PM] 5298_
Changing the macbre topic slightly, how are you at making games? I have a good concept but no fucking clue how to make it

considering i was doing it for 4 years

I'm thinking, you have a battlefield and you move your troops to certain positions to try and win wars. You can have full scale wars where you have to pick which battles you take to try and win the war, taking land ( back ) from your enemies. You can have a whole range of different assets that move slightly differently, so tanks would move slower than everyone else, cavalry wouldn't be able to move up steep hill that well, infantry would be able to create trenches and be divided into smaller platoons

My mum heavily believes in psychics, but not the ones that charge people for their services because at that point they're just exploiting grief. But, anyways, she found a TikTok live psychic and while I wouldn't normally call them accurate, she took her chance because she wanted some form of comfort I guess. The things that psychic said where fucking unbelievable in terms of how accurate they were, and considering it was a tiktok psychic it genuinely stumped me. In fact, she said she heard the name of my other uncle and some other things and that just fucking blew me away.


[02/06/2023 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Normally psychics are vague as shit because it's easy to manipulate the person youre seeing, but the psychic on this live was really specific and got everything right


[02/06/2023 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
beforehand i thought they were a bunch of bullshit


[02/06/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
You know masking?


[02/06/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No what is that


[02/06/2023 10:37 PM] 5298_
It's used in a lot of different situations but what I'm on about it when Autistic people pretend to not be autistic and try to act normal


[02/06/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh


[02/06/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
I used to _heavily_ mask, you know in year 8 I would act normal, I've stopped that now, I'm acting more like how I actually am


[02/06/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
It's probably not a good thing because I'm getting less work done but I'm happy so oh well


[02/06/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/07/2023 5:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Discord is in that server


[02/07/2023 5:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
watching you whilst you are completely oblivious to the fact

[02/07/2023 5:05 PM] 5298_
I hate how Saint Denis is pronounced


[02/07/2023 5:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
tis french city


[02/07/2023 5:05 PM] 5298_
It should be Saint Denis not san denee


[02/07/2023 5:06 PM] 5298_
It's in America though


[02/07/2023 5:07 PM] 5298_
It makes sense when you say it with a french accent but an American saying it makes no sense, the French ""person"" is saying Saint Denis with an accent, the American is saying San denee


[02/07/2023 5:09 PM] 5298_
It looks miserable


[02/07/2023 5:16 PM] 5298_

I don't think the Universe has a boundary


[02/07/2023 6:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think that there's finite objects, but the space in the Universe is infinite


[02/07/2023 6:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The space between objects is expanding way faster than the speed of light in some areas, so there's galaxies that are passed the point in the Universe where light can no longer reach them


[02/07/2023 6:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Does that mean they're outside of the Universe?


[02/07/2023 6:23 PM] 5298_
We need another term


[02/07/2023 6:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Another term?


[02/07/2023 6:23 PM] 5298_
Observable universe, universe and another one for the part of the universe there is light


[02/07/2023 6:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[02/07/2023 6:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I agree


[02/07/2023 6:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exouniverse


[02/07/2023 6:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Extrauniverse


[02/07/2023 6:24 PM] 5298_
The observable universe is how much we can see, the illuminated universe has light and the universe is everything


[02/07/2023 6:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exoverse


[02/07/2023 6:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exoverse is the name of a game


[02/07/2023 6:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like the term Exouniverse


[02/07/2023 6:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What if time is just a loop, and we have only been around for such a short time that it looks like a line


[02/07/2023 6:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What if the universe is infinite, but it almost like an omniverse of sorts where theres pockets of other universes lying around that are reachable


[02/07/2023 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dark energy doesnt make sense


[02/07/2023 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if its energy, and its being created then it isnt exactly energy


[02/07/2023 6:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If dark energy really is being created, then i doubt the universe would die from heat death but rather that one theory where dark energy becomes so abundant everything collapses


[02/07/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Eventually the amount of dark energy being created wouldnt be enough to sustain the universes growth and therefore it would slow down


[02/07/2023 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/07/2023 6:57 PM] 5298_
Also, there has never been a period of human history where you could become king of the world.

No one has owned the entire planet


[02/07/2023 6:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and im assuming hes trying to compare himself to a king but he should be comparing himself more towards a pyramid schemist


[02/07/2023 6:58 PM] 5298_
And the one who came the closest was a woman so I don't think Mr. Ihaveanicecarandasmallcock would like that


[02/07/2023 6:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Hes also trying to call himself king of the world but hes only the king of obese children and incels


[02/07/2023 6:59 PM] 5298_

Im assuming its a tornado and not a waterspout because from my perspective it made landfall


[02/07/2023 7:02 PM] 5298_
Weird that Japan still has an emperor and calls him an emperor


[02/07/2023 7:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Like, Maths, physics, etymology, anything


[02/07/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
still uncertain


[02/07/2023 10:15 PM] 5298_
I would argue philosophy


[02/07/2023 10:16 PM] 5298_
I would further argue that religion is the most important part of philosophy but that's a different thing


[02/07/2023 10:23 PM] 5298_
Ultimately, every school of thought is trying to answer questions about the human experience and philosophy above all else is the study of the human experience, it is trying to answer questions no one has asked as well as ones we have always asked. And as Philosophy is the study of the human experience then religion must be the most important part of philosophy. There are only 500 million atheists in the world so obviously religion is a large part of the human experience. It makes up most world governments and morals. I'm a bit tired so I don't know if that made any sense

Isn't it called Yiddish


[02/07/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And hebrew


[02/07/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
Yeah, Hebrew and Yiddish


[02/07/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
How many other countries have names like that, where their language or people aren't named after the country


[02/07/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
Israel speaks Hebrew


[02/07/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
Obviously countries that speak foreign languages because of colonialism won't have their language names after their country


[02/07/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
So that's all of the Americas and every francophone gone


[02/07/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
And Australia and New Zealand


[02/07/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
Canada and America speak English
Mexico speaks Spanish 
I'm pretty sure most of central America also speaks Spanish
Most of South America speak Portuguese

Because Abraham is the first Jew and it's all of his descendents who will be the Israelites, Isaac's blood line goes onto found Judaism but is Ishamael and his children Jewish?


[02/07/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
Because Ishmael's blood line goes onto found Islam


[02/07/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
And Muslims aren't Jewish but Ishamael is


[02/08/2023 12:14 AM] 5298_
I'm pissed off

[02/08/2023 12:15 AM] 5298_
What the fuck is this, why?


[02/08/2023 12:15 AM] 5298_
What does that achieve?


[02/08/2023 2:53 PM] 5298_
I'm going to blow Micah head clean off


[02/08/2023 5:10 PM] 5298_
Dutch has lost his fucking mind


[02/08/2023 5:10 PM] 5298_
He thinks we all hate him save for Micah


[02/08/2023 5:11 PM] 5298_
The story is getting really good


[02/08/2023 6:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects in all cases when there is no atmosphere, albeit the rate of acceleration would be so similar it wouldnt be noticeable


[02/08/2023 6:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But the more massive an object is, the more gravity it has which im pretty sure everyone knows


[02/08/2023 6:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Er ist mein F√ºhrer


[02/08/2023 7:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ich habe alle die Juden


[02/08/2023 7:25 PM] 5298_
FUCK SAKE


[02/08/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WHAT IS THE FUCKS SAKE


[02/08/2023 7:25 PM] 5298_
FUCK THIS STUPID GAME


[02/08/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was going to talk to you about that but forgot about it


[02/08/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think that its fucking stupid


[02/08/2023 7:25 PM] 5298_
SEAN, HOSEA, JOHN AND NOW FUCKING LENNY


[02/08/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I felt the same


[02/08/2023 7:26 PM] 5298_
THIS STUPID GAME KILLS ALL THE BEST CHARACTERS


[02/08/2023 7:26 PM] 5298_
WHY COULDN'T MICAH DIE


[02/08/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's part of the story


[02/08/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and whilst they didnt need to die


[02/08/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think the reasons behind their deaths fuel the story


[02/08/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
who do you blame hoseas and lennys death on


[02/08/2023 7:27 PM] 5298_
The Pinkertons


[02/08/2023 7:28 PM] 5298_
I understand it's a crucial part to the story and the game _is_ about the fall of the Van Der Linde gang but it still hurts


[02/08/2023 7:31 PM] 5298_
I read the article and it's the Church of England wanting to completely edit the Bible into removing any reference to God being referred to as Father or Him to make it more inclusive


[02/08/2023 7:31 PM] 5298_
But how does that make sense?


[02/08/2023 7:33 PM] 5298_
How does changing God from one thing to another make Christianity more inclusive? The 11th commandment is already "Love _everyone_ as I have loved you" surely that's inclusive. Making God gender neutral or, as the rest of the article proposes, a woman achieves nothing


[02/08/2023 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Especially since for the last 2000 or so years hes been referred to as the father and him


[02/08/2023 7:39 PM] 5298_
What will the trinity be referred to as then?


[02/08/2023 7:39 PM] 5298_
God the Parent 
God the Child
God the Holy Spirit


[02/08/2023 7:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The Parent The Child


[02/08/2023 7:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and the Holy Spirit


[02/08/2023 7:41 PM] 5298_
So we're in Cuba now


[02/08/2023 7:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what


[02/08/2023 7:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh yes


[02/08/2023 7:43 PM] 5298_
Apparently not because the boats being beaten like Churchill's wife


[02/08/2023 7:44 PM] 5298_
This game took a turn


[02/08/2023 7:45 PM] 5298_
HOW LONG WAS I IN THE OCEAN


[02/08/2023 7:45 PM] 5298_
I WAS CLEAN SHAVEN ON THE BOAT AND NOW I HAVE A FULL BEARD ON LAND


[02/08/2023 7:46 PM] 5298_
I'm guessing we spend chapter 5 getting enough money to leave where ever the fuck we are


[02/08/2023 8:08 PM] 5298_
Wait


[02/08/2023 8:08 PM] 5298_
I've just realised something


[02/08/2023 8:08 PM] 5298_
MY HORSE


[02/08/2023 8:09 PM] 5298_
SHE'S STILL IN AMERICA


[02/08/2023 8:09 PM] 5298_
I will get back to her even if I have to swim across the Pacific


[02/08/2023 8:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
chapter 5 is very short


[02/08/2023 8:10 PM] 5298_
Charles better not be dead


[02/08/2023 8:19 PM] 5298_
I did not expect to end up on Guama


[02/08/2023 8:21 PM] 5298_
FUCK SAKE


[02/08/2023 8:21 PM] 5298_
JAVIER TOO


[02/08/2023 8:22 PM] 5298_
At this rate Arthur'll be the only one left


[02/08/2023 8:25 PM] 5298_
Oh my God that's the ending isn't it ( don't actually tell me )


[02/08/2023 8:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
really hate poopen fart


[02/08/2023 8:44 PM] 5298_
I fucking hate this


[02/08/2023 8:45 PM] 5298_
I can't do the missions because if I get anywhere near Dutch the guards are alerted and the missions locks


[02/08/2023 8:47 PM] 5298_
I can't wait to get to America


[02/08/2023 8:51 PM] 5298_
Oh


[02/08/2023 8:51 PM] 5298_
My


[02/08/2023 8:51 PM] 5298_
God


[02/08/2023 8:51 PM] 5298_
John's a traitor


[02/08/2023 8:52 PM] 5298_
Abigale and John both survived the bank job because they're traitors


[02/08/2023 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wud the heyll


[02/08/2023 8:54 PM] 5298_
John is a traitor, Dutch has gone fucking mad and everyone else is dead


[02/08/2023 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Really now


[02/08/2023 8:54 PM] 5298_
That's my running theory, I'm still in Guama though so things could change


[02/08/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
Thank fuck we're getting off this island


[02/08/2023 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i feel like my life is going to be fucking horrible


[02/08/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
I feel like mine will be shit but I have an audacious plan


[02/08/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What is that plan


[02/08/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think i am going to get excluded in the next week


[02/08/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
The Land of the Free


[02/08/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
america


[02/08/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
Why?


[02/08/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I didnt go to my afterschool detention today


[02/08/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and mr devlin wasnt happy when i turned up to school late


[02/08/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its not my fault i have family and shit that also need to get ready


[02/08/2023 9:23 PM] 5298_
You should just never sleep so you're always ready to go to school


[02/08/2023 9:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is literally what they expect though


[02/08/2023 9:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My dad agrees with all my views on school


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
Have you seen those vans people turn into homes?


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I would like one


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
I want to live like that


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like a lonely gypsy


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I would like to live like that too


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
I'm going to do some research on costs


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It sounds fucking horrible but Id save up to make mine feel like a home


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and that would be it


[02/08/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I would be living all over the country


[02/08/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyd find a way to tax you anyway lmao


[02/08/2023 9:26 PM] 5298_
Yeah, that's why I want to go to America


[02/08/2023 9:26 PM] 5298_
They have far better laws for free-living


[02/08/2023 9:26 PM] 5298_
And all the land isn't owned by famers


[02/08/2023 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I almost certain there is somewhere after death


[02/08/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And if there isn't then i wouldnt have a fucking clue id be dead


[02/08/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or at least the existence of souls


[02/08/2023 9:30 PM] 5298_
I wouldn't like a caravan that's built for living in because they're just depressing


[02/08/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We've convinced each other that there must be somewhere after death lmfao


[02/08/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like 2 months ago we were saying we dont think theres anything


[02/08/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
I'm like 48% sure I believe in God now too


[02/08/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I still dont believe in a god


[02/08/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
It sounds stupid but I think I think God gave me a sign


[02/08/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It never sounds stupid


[02/08/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what was the sign


[02/08/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'd say im an agnostic atheist


[02/08/2023 9:34 PM] 5298_
I was watching Wendigoons video on the Christian conspiracy iceberg and I heard the name Methuselah, so ( and this is important ) PAUSED the video and googled the name, I saw that he was the son of Enoch and immediately thought ( with the video still being paused ) "from the book of Enoch" then I resumed the video and later heard that the book of Enoch isn't Biblical canon. Then I realised I had never heard of that book ever, I have never seen a Bible with it in, I've only ever met Catholics and C of E members and neither of them believe in the book of Enoch, I should have no knowledge of that books existence and yet I knew it was real


[02/08/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Interesting


[02/08/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was also watching that video the other night i think


[02/08/2023 9:36 PM] 5298_
I hate the term agnostic because of course atheists are agnostic, no logical person would not believe in God if they had undeniable proof, unless you're Sarah


[02/08/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'd say considering you were watching wendigoon you may have heard the name and whilst you may not have picked up on it consciously, you remembered it subconsciously


[02/08/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But there isn't undeniable proof


[02/08/2023 9:36 PM] 5298_
Perhaps


[02/08/2023 9:36 PM] 5298_
Exactly


[02/08/2023 9:36 PM] 5298_
So every atheist is agnostic


[02/08/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
Or they would be religious


[02/08/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There's no undeniable proof for either side


[02/08/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But I believe it's still possible to believe in a god or not with absolute certainty


[02/08/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
But the only Christian videos I'd watched of his were the Divine Comedy, Paradise Lost and the angel video and none of them mention the book of Enoch


[02/08/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
Wait


[02/08/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
One second


[02/08/2023 9:39 PM] 5298_
No


[02/08/2023 9:40 PM] 5298_
It wasn't mentioned in The Lost Books of the Bible


[02/08/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If people can comprehend an infinite future why can they not comprehend an infinite past


[02/08/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I heard that question yesterday


[02/08/2023 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If god created the universe and put trillions of galaxies, each containing 100 billion stars in them, with most of them having at least 1 planet, inside of it


[02/08/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
why would he care about 1 planet in 1 galaxy


[02/08/2023 9:46 PM] 5298_
He doesn't


[02/08/2023 9:47 PM] 5298_
He cares about humanity


[02/08/2023 9:47 PM] 5298_
Not Earth


[02/08/2023 9:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why would he care about 1 species


[02/08/2023 9:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why not care for all of creation?


[02/08/2023 9:47 PM] 5298_
That's why Adam and Eve weren't put on Earth, they were put in the Garden because Earth isn't special


[02/08/2023 9:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I don't believe adam and eve is a real story


[02/08/2023 9:48 PM] 5298_
We are supposed to be the species of love, God created us to show His love


[02/08/2023 9:48 PM] 5298_
And He does care for all of creation


[02/08/2023 9:49 PM] 5298_
A Prophet I don't remember the name of had a vision of God's Throne and along with the Angels and Jesus there were Oxen and Gazel and all sorts of animals


[02/08/2023 9:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But why us? Considering the size of the Universe, there are probably billions of species very similar to us.


[02/08/2023 9:50 PM] 5298_
Well maybe there is no other life out there, maybe we're God's creation


[02/08/2023 9:50 PM] 5298_
Also, I've had a thought


[02/08/2023 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If there's a god, I don't think it would be anything like the God shown in the Abrahamic Religions.


[02/08/2023 9:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If live is on earth then life is everywhere conductive for it


[02/08/2023 9:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or almost everywhere


[02/08/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Life appearing was a chemical reaction


[02/08/2023 9:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Chemical reactions happen everywhere in the Universe


[02/08/2023 9:54 PM] 5298_
If God did create the universe, then the universe's age could be a lot less then we think it is because God is all powerful he can make the universe appear any age


[02/08/2023 9:54 PM] 5298_
Just a thought


[02/08/2023 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If God could stop natural disasters he would


[02/08/2023 9:55 PM] 5298_
He wouldn't


[02/08/2023 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If He exists of course


[02/08/2023 9:55 PM] 5298_
Natural disasters are a consequence of original sin


[02/08/2023 9:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Natural disasters are a result of the laws of physics


[02/08/2023 9:56 PM] 5298_
He wouldn't make it easier for the whole of humanity because we are supposed to suffer on Earth


[02/08/2023 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If he was to change the law of physics in one place that would mean he would have change them all across the universe


[02/08/2023 9:57 PM] 5298_
Yes but the reason they behave like that is because that's how God designed them


[02/08/2023 9:57 PM] 5298_
And there are natural disasters all across the universe


[02/08/2023 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But why would he punish the whole universe for the actions of 1 species on 1 planet


[02/08/2023 9:58 PM] 5298_
Because there is no other life out there


[02/08/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That we know of


[02/08/2023 9:58 PM] 5298_
And He knows we will try and venture out there and we still won't be able to escape our punishment


[02/08/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Enceladus

The plumes from its surface contain organic molecules among other things


[02/08/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the thermal vents beneath the icy layer could definitely hold some form of life, even if its microbial


[02/08/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is how life first came together on earth


[02/08/2023 10:09 PM] 5298_
I don't fucking know

I'm still looking at live in vans


[02/08/2023 10:09 PM] 5298_

I will basically never be in barrow


[02/08/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when i get the chance


[02/08/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or at least i hope that will be the case


[02/08/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If you live in a van in the us


[02/08/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/08/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A lot of tornado deaths are from trailers and shit

[02/08/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
I have a plan for what I want


[02/08/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
I don't want anything like that, that's just a house on wheels which isn't what I want


[02/08/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_
I want to live on the road, spend my time outside so I won't need a fancy place to live. Just a place to sleep and store my stuff


[02/08/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want a house on wheels


[02/08/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sounds very cool


[02/08/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
house with chicken legs


[02/08/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
Like Baba Yaga


[02/08/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[02/08/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
except it wouldnt take me into the fucking gobi desert at the peak of summer


[02/08/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
They were Russian, they didn't know what heat was


[02/08/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
World war 3 slowly marches closes


[02/08/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fuck zelensky


[02/08/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
hes trying to make nato toy with the idea of nuking russia the daft cunt


[02/08/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
The world is fucked


[02/08/2023 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we're in the middle of a cost of living crisis and hes still manipulating nato and especially the uk into sending money and equipment


[02/08/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
If NATO nukes Russia the world will die


[02/08/2023 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Zelensky is fucked


[02/08/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
Why the fuck is he president


[02/08/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We shouldve let ukraine crumble instead of sending shit to them


[02/08/2023 10:51 PM] 5298_
He's a comedian for fuck sake


[02/08/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There wouldve been way less deaths


[02/08/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It would be drawn out sure but not as drawn out as it is in this moment in time


[02/08/2023 10:51 PM] 5298_
It's not about Ukraine it's about not letting Russia rebuild into the USSR


[02/08/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they wouldnt rebuild the ussr rather the russian empire


[02/08/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its clear communism failed


[02/08/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
china isnt communist


[02/08/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they claim to be but they arent


[02/08/2023 10:52 PM] 5298_
That's not what the West believes


[02/08/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its the west though


[02/08/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think its natos fault that all of this is happening


[02/08/2023 10:53 PM] 5298_
Fact doesn't matter, the west's beliefs do, if the west believes that Russia is trying to rebuild the USSR then they are


[02/08/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant tell if thats sarcastic


[02/08/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmao


[02/08/2023 10:53 PM] 5298_
It's not


[02/08/2023 10:53 PM] 5298_
Fact means fuck all to the people in charge


[02/08/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think i understand


[02/08/2023 10:54 PM] 5298_
America will go to war with Russia if they believe that Communism is gaining power, even if it isn't


[02/08/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[02/08/2023 10:54 PM] 5298_
Just look at that fucking balloon


[02/08/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the us is weak as fuck


[02/08/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they have the largest military


[02/08/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and best funded


[02/08/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but


[02/08/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
They're powerful they're just retarded


[02/08/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
They're Goliath


[02/08/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats what i meant


[02/08/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
Strong but they don't know what to do


[02/08/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
China would probably do quite well against the us


[02/08/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
Nuclear war will never happen


[02/08/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope it does


[02/08/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fuck the world


[02/08/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
itll teach everyone a lesson


[02/08/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
actually idk


[02/08/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
Nukes will only be used against countries that have no access to them and no allies that have access to them


[02/08/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wait actually i do know


[02/08/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
world war 2 seems to have taught germany a lesson


[02/08/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
imagine if germany were allowed to keep their claims on prussia after reunification


[02/08/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
Germany is the perfect example of why America would fail in a war against Russia


[02/08/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/08/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
perfect ingredients for a shit show


[02/08/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
They're powerful but have nutjobs in charge


[02/08/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It seems they like to lose to farmers though


[02/08/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
I would say they learned their lesson but I doubt it


[02/08/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Vietnam


[02/08/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and more recently afghanistan


[02/08/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
I doubt America would even make it Volgograd before winter


[02/08/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[02/08/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Do they just change the name of towns whenever the leader dies


[02/08/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the russians apparently are trying to rename volgograd back to stalingrad


[02/08/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
No


[02/08/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
They named it Volgograd during the destalinisation


[02/08/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Putingrad road exists

[02/08/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Chernenkograd


[02/08/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Zelensky should get blown up by a russian drone


[02/08/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and his wife


[02/08/2023 11:04 PM] 5298_
Bit far?


[02/08/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[02/08/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
never too far


[02/08/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ukraine should become an extension of the black sea


[02/08/2023 11:05 PM] 5298_
Blow it to Kingdom Come


[02/08/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[02/08/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and burn zelensky and his wife to the stake


[02/08/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and also do all the torture methods i described the other day to them


[02/08/2023 11:06 PM] 5298_
Fucking hell


[02/08/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

_Nothing?_


[02/08/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How can people still say we arent in the early stages of the third world war


[02/08/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wonder what the world map will look like in 10 years


[02/08/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
probably stalingrad but nato


[02/08/2023 11:09 PM] 5298_
What about British soldiers? What about British civilians? What about Britain itself. When do we stop? When Putin is knocking on number fucking ten


[02/08/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
imagine if the tsar bomba was 100 megatons


[02/08/2023 11:45 PM] 5298_
I've never wanted to be alive more than I do right now


[02/08/2023 11:45 PM] 5298_
I don't know why


[02/09/2023 3:52 PM] 5298_
Jesus is a socialist and I won't hear any different


[02/09/2023 6:08 PM] 5298_
I think I'm dead


[02/09/2023 6:09 PM] 5298_
I just woke up even though I don't remember going to sleep, I'm like 70% sure I'm awake and I can't tell if my memories are real or if I dreamt them

[02/09/2023 6:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Unless we both died at the same time


[02/09/2023 6:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/09/2023 7:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

The New World Order


[02/09/2023 7:15 PM] 5298_
The UN
NATO
SCO
ASEAN

MERCOSER
Pacific Alliance 
Arab League
Central American Parliament


[02/09/2023 7:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[02/09/2023 7:20 PM] 5298_
NATO will rule the world and only the SCO can stop them but undoubtedly if they do, they will just try to as well


[02/09/2023 7:21 PM] 5298_
That's why NATO is gunning so hard for Russia, they're trying to dismantle their biggest threat, SCO


[02/09/2023 7:21 PM] 5298_
We've already seen that NATO countries can take over the world throughout history


[02/09/2023 7:22 PM] 5298_
The Vatican will undoubtedly help them


[02/09/2023 7:23 PM] 5298_

China has a large population but not much control, how many Chinese people will treat every word Xi Jinping says as gospel? And how many Catholics will treat everything the Pope says as gospel?


[02/09/2023 7:26 PM] 5298_
We've seen before that the Pope can just draw a line and entire continents are under new control

since when were you christian


[02/09/2023 7:34 PM] 5298_
Something will come that will take the world and someone else will be in charge of that, and we will worship both of them as they destroy us


[02/09/2023 7:35 PM] 5298_

I am honestly starting to side with russia a bit


[02/09/2023 9:00 PM] 5298_
I side with neither


[02/09/2023 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think both sides are fucking stupid


[02/09/2023 9:01 PM] 5298_
Russia is just England 2 and NATO is The New World Order and Zelensky shouldn't even be president


[02/09/2023 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but more and more evidence shows that nato and zelensky are trying to start world war 3


[02/09/2023 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and it seems more like theyre bullying russia a bit


[02/09/2023 9:02 PM] 5298_
That doesn't mean Russia is good


[02/09/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fair enough


[02/09/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not saying russia is good though


[02/09/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im saying at the minute it seems nato wants millions to die


[02/09/2023 9:05 PM] 5298_
No they don't


[02/09/2023 9:06 PM] 5298_
They want power and are willing to let millions die for it to happen


[02/09/2023 9:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/09/2023 9:55 PM] 5298_
Arthur keeps seeing it when we go into a new chapter


[02/09/2023 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Get your honor up its a nicer image


[02/09/2023 9:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/09/2023 9:58 PM] 5298_
That makes sense


[02/09/2023 9:58 PM] 5298_
I'm going to do loads of side quests tomorrow


[02/09/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Low honor gives you wolf images and high honor gives you stag images


[02/09/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but now your honor isnt locked like it was before


[02/09/2023 9:59 PM] 5298_
When was it locked?


[02/09/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
until chapter 6


[02/09/2023 10:00 PM] 5298_
But my honor has been going up and down since chapter 2


[02/09/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes but its locked on one side of the spectrum


[02/09/2023 10:00 PM] 5298_
Ohhh


[02/09/2023 10:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why is the Nicola Bulley case getting so much attention

What does these mean


[02/09/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is her and her husbands company and that is the court threatening to dissolve it


[02/09/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
Why


[02/09/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because she owed 54 grand


[02/09/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
Oh

God knows

[02/09/2023 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/09/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_
That looks good


[02/09/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If i had to make a currency the coins would look somewhat like that


[02/09/2023 10:22 PM] 5298_
Will the notes still have the same people on them?


[02/09/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

It's better than Liverpool


[02/09/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It looks lifeless and oversaturated


[02/09/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/11/2023 12:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/11/2023 12:28 PM] 5298_
My mum's just shouted at me for my "toan" when she knows I don't understand that. Her boyfriend has just patronised me because I didn't understand what the fuck is happening with the options


[02/11/2023 12:29 PM] 5298_
He didn't even explain it correctly, he explained what happened every other year when I said that it was different this year so yet again no one fucking listens


[02/11/2023 12:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's fucking annoying when nobody listens to what you have to say


[02/11/2023 12:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/11/2023 1:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Everything


[02/11/2023 1:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's harder to gain honor than it is to lose


[02/11/2023 1:39 PM] 5298_
I have been and my honor isn't going up


[02/11/2023 1:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Same


[02/11/2023 1:47 PM] 5298_
The cold war started when America and Russia got nukes and it will end when no one has them


[02/11/2023 1:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The cold war to me was extreme tension between nato and russia and the tension hasnt really died down since then

What path did you get


[02/11/2023 9:17 PM] 5298_
I haven't got mine yet


[02/11/2023 9:17 PM] 5298_
I'm going to be disappointed no matter what I get


[02/11/2023 9:17 PM] 5298_
The only one that has all the options I want is the English one but I refuse to do French

It's terrifying that people can't imagine a system without capitalism


[02/11/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
It's always just a new form of capitalism

"Rosc Catha na Mumhan" - Irish Patriotic Song
An old Jacobite song with a very familiar tune...

very similar to come out ye black and tans


[02/11/2023 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
especially the start


[02/11/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
I think that Come Out Ye Black and Tans is based on that song


[02/11/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
A lot of rebel music will be based on traditional songs

[02/12/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
CHICKEN


[02/12/2023 12:12 AM] 5298_

I'm making a children's book for my little cousin where a mouse goes to the market, buys some stuff and then they all have a roast dinner at the end. It's for a 5 year old


[02/12/2023 1:11 AM] 5298_
How do I draw a butchers shop that's suitable for a 5 year old


[02/12/2023 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/12/2023 1:18 AM] 5298_
I just didn't draw any meat

Quite a few of my beliefs lie dangerously close to Fascism


[02/12/2023 1:55 PM] 5298_
At least from what I've been told


[02/12/2023 1:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Who told you that


[02/12/2023 1:59 PM] 5298_
A lot of anti-globalisation, traditional-life beliefs align with Fascistic beliefs

I've figured out how to make a game


[02/12/2023 4:37 PM] 5298_
I'll need 2D top-down sprites for it, I could make some ( probably ) or if you want you could


[02/12/2023 4:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Unity?


[02/12/2023 4:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Boardgames are much easier to make but all the pieces need to be physical which is harder

[02/12/2023 6:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What is it


[02/12/2023 6:46 PM] 5298_
It's about a painting called "Irony of a Negro Policeman" and the whole video consists of a white man interviewing a white man about what his white father's arrest says about the police force's relationship with black people


[02/12/2023 6:49 PM] 5298_
Surely if you're making a video about the hypocrisy of an Africa-American police officer then it would make sense to interview black people and get their experience and not people who it doesn't relate to


[02/12/2023 6:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I find it really stupid that people use the first commandment to say that Christians admit their God isn't the only God therefore Christianity is a lie


[02/12/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
Other religions exist, God knows this and tells His people to hold God before them and to not worship those Gods ( as seen in the second commandment ) and then it's also that we should hold God the Father in the highest regard above God the Son and God the Holy Spirit

[02/13/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate school


[02/13/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate the system


[02/13/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to live in the lake district in a beautiful cabin that overlooks cumbria


[02/13/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and a camper van


[02/13/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i can drive around the country


[02/13/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and a car so i can actually go places


[02/13/2023 11:09 PM] 5298_
I want to go to the lakes more often


[02/13/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to do some storm chasing when i get a car


[02/13/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and get a camera


[02/13/2023 11:10 PM] 5298_
I think you should work in the Met Office


[02/13/2023 11:10 PM] 5298_
You seem to enjoy it


[02/13/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe


[02/13/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can see meteorologist being a viable career path


[02/13/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i have a basic understanding of how climate shit works and weather phenomena


[02/13/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i also like computer science


[02/13/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe i could make a weather model


[02/13/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or make some breakthroughs with a simulation


[02/13/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
I don't see a career being right for me


[02/13/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
I don't want this life


[02/13/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I understand


[02/13/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I also feel that way but my only option to live an okay life would be to find an okay career that fits me and fits my needs


[02/13/2023 11:15 PM] 5298_
Everyone is pretty much told to turn into their parents minus their mistakes but I don't want that


[02/13/2023 11:19 PM] 5298_
I look at my Dad's life and the only positives I see are his family, and I don't want a family. The closest I'd get is a girlfriend and maybe a pet, I don't want a wife ( if that's even legal ) or any kids. If I look at every other part of his life it seems miserable, his job is shit so he has to strike, he's in a country where the government works against him, he has to pay an absence amount of bills and still we didn't have water for weeks because of pipes being shit and we had to pay to get the community ( council ) pipes fixed. And, the NHS couldn't help when he needed it


[02/13/2023 11:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure where I stand on family


[02/13/2023 11:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe I want children maybe I dont


[02/13/2023 11:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure


[02/13/2023 11:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I will probably have children of course


[02/13/2023 11:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to live a nice live where i can travel freely


[02/13/2023 11:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it seems the country is too shit


[02/13/2023 11:22 PM] 5298_
I'm not asexual ( from the best of my understanding, I think it's hard to know if you're a virgin if you don't like sex but maybe I'm just retarded ) but kids make me want to die, I had nervous breakdowns when I had to look after my little cousin and I'm not a good person to parent, I have a quick and violent temper and I think it would be unfair to subject my children to that


[02/13/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_
Maybe my view will change


[02/13/2023 11:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My children would probably be little shits, but I find the idea of descendants of me fascinating. The product of an unbroken bloodline spanning for billions of years. They look at the stars, the Moon and the Sun. The same that I saw, that my ancestors saw. The blue sky is the same that my ancestors saw. They are experiencing the same world as I did, but the technology and resources will be vastly different. They, hopefully, will outlive me, and continue my bloodline for another billion years.


[02/13/2023 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe the world will go to shit and Ill find it cruel to bring children into existence


[02/13/2023 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but thats how i feel so far


[02/13/2023 11:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But, before I have children, I think it's my responsibility to find a nice place to live. A place that is isolated, but beautiful. Where they can see nature, and not an endless abandoned concrete jungle with polluted and dangerous air.


[02/13/2023 11:29 PM] 5298_
It's a fascinating and noble venture

[02/13/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Im trying to use yellow and black to indicate caution, but that idea doesnt feel right and I might change the colours up


[02/16/2023 5:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Red is a contrasting colour to yellow, because it also a warm colour and can indicate power and strength

If you make a language we should say that a team of people deciphered an old language native to the area and we're officially making it the countries national language to keep in touch with our history

its so shit


[02/17/2023 7:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i actually want to try learn the language but its just jargon


[02/17/2023 7:57 PM] 5298_
To be fair it is a dead Gaelic language that's only partially recovered. It's not going to make that much sense to a native English speaker


[02/17/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its not the same as cumbric


[02/17/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cumbraek is a reconstruction, which uses pieces of cumbric and infuses it with a version based on other p-celtic languages (ones like welsh, cornish etc.)


[02/17/2023 7:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But the thing is absolutely everything is jargon


[02/17/2023 7:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Our unacceptance of South Walney as a country should definitely be made clear but we don't want to start a war just yet. Denounce them and keep a close eye but don't publicly mobilise any troops


[02/17/2023 11:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WAR!


[02/17/2023 11:20 PM] 5298_
Not yet, public support and the wellbeing of our nations should be our priority

National Security is one of the most important aspects of a country. We watch as other nations underestimate its importance, and watch them get torn down. In order to improve national security, we have decided to form an alliance with @BarrowRepublic.


[02/17/2023 11:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Seems a bit bland


[02/17/2023 11:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
National Security is one of the most important aspects of a country. We watch as other nations underestimate its importance, and watch them get torn down. Because we must hold it in such a high position, and because of the threatening stance the South takes, @BarrowRepublic and the Republic of North Walney are part of a military alliance. We will fight until we can't!


[02/17/2023 11:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

The Republic of Furness believes in the virtue of togetherness and to ensure that all of us here on the Furness peninsula can live in that togetherness, our great nation has formally signed an alliance with the Republic of North Walney. This relationship will help us all prosper.

Explain


[02/18/2023 5:48 PM] 5298_
We need naval superiority so I'll get BAE to craft as many ships as we can make and they can protect your naval territory, then for the first invasion of South Walney I'll attempt to take Peil Island and a naval base and you can make sure SW doesn't launch any fleets off the west coast and I'll survey the east coast then we form a pincer movement heading from your border and the south of SW into the capital. You also have the air field so we could even bomb him from the air


[02/18/2023 5:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Would take a bit of negotiation


[02/18/2023 5:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"yes bae can we have all your ships and submarines so we can fucking invade south walney"


[02/18/2023 5:49 PM] 5298_
I won't tell them it's for an invasion, it's to protect our glorious nation from the southern threat

[02/18/2023 5:51 PM] 5298_
We need to wait for Reece to do something radical


[02/18/2023 5:52 PM] 5298_
I'll do military exercises close to his borders and make him feel threatened, if we can make him do something radical we have an excuse to take out SW and start our plans


[02/18/2023 5:52 PM] 5298_
In the mean time, I'll expand my borders further up the peninsula

I like having the alternative modern day, eventually things could come to a bitter end with our nations falling ( that would probably involve war with England because of some of my plans ) but for now let's deal with Reece


[02/18/2023 6:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

post-apocalyptic i meant


[02/18/2023 6:19 PM] 5298_
What apocalypse? Nuclear Armageddon is what I'm thinking of


[02/18/2023 6:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[02/18/2023 6:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am also thinking of that


[02/18/2023 6:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WW3


[02/18/2023 6:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then nuke


[02/18/2023 6:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then death of lots of humans


[02/18/2023 6:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
which is every post apocalyptic story ever


[02/18/2023 6:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but still


[02/18/2023 6:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or a giant asteroid came and did some damage


[02/18/2023 6:20 PM] 5298_
Here's an idea


[02/18/2023 6:22 PM] 5298_
An asteroid destroys most of Afric-Euroasia and Oceania and America dealing with the affects but not effected directly and are basically cut off from those three continents, the faction that rise are trying to take control of the resources that are left in the wake of the catastrophe and also the resources from the astroid itself


[02/18/2023 6:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive just made a meteor with a 419km fireball lmfao

Launch the meteor at Port Sudan - Jeddah

In my own alternate timeline, north walney would start as a very democratic nation, and whatnot but it would be overthrown by a very militaristic and nationalist group, which would then invade south walney and furness


[02/18/2023 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
this group would form the cumbrian empire, but the people crave freedom


[02/18/2023 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then a civil war would begin


[02/18/2023 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Rocky road to dublin


[02/18/2023 7:43 PM] 5298_
Good song


[02/18/2023 7:44 PM] 5298_
That sounds good


[02/18/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oro se bheatha bhaile


[02/18/2023 7:57 PM] 5298_
Very good song that


[02/18/2023 7:58 PM] 5298_
It's a wedding song transformed for the cause


[02/18/2023 7:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[02/18/2023 7:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I will try and make some war songs for walney


[02/18/2023 8:05 PM] 5298_
If we're doing that post-apocalyptic thing what do we do about our accounts?


[02/18/2023 8:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its just an idea for something i might do in the future


[02/18/2023 8:06 PM] 5298_
So do we carry on with the story we were already telling


[02/18/2023 8:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[02/18/2023 8:08 PM] 5298_
I just opened Twitter

I'm telling Reece to make a Twitter


[02/18/2023 8:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[02/18/2023 8:14 PM] 5298_
I don't think he should tell us many of his plans so that we can naturally react to anything he does and vice-versa


[02/18/2023 8:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ja


[02/18/2023 8:16 PM] 5298_
Reece Wright-McDonald, you should make a Twitter account for South Walney so you can tell your side of the story you, Rylan and I are crafting. Keep your plans to yourself and we will ours so we can naturally react to anything we do. I think this will make a fluid and natural story


[02/18/2023 8:17 PM] 5298_
Rylan stop asking Reece about his plans


[02/18/2023 8:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What


[02/18/2023 8:18 PM] 5298_
Reece said you were asking him about his plans


[02/18/2023 8:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I havent been


[02/18/2023 8:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive just been asking him to make a twitter


[02/18/2023 8:20 PM] 5298_
He isn't talking about the twitter, he's saying he's going to hold Snap elections


[02/18/2023 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What?


[02/18/2023 8:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He's never said that to me lmfao

[02/18/2023 8:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao


[02/18/2023 8:22 PM] 5298_
I don't know


[02/18/2023 8:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How is that relevant to the twitter


[02/18/2023 8:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why is he sharing his plans


[02/18/2023 8:24 PM] 5298_
No clue


[02/18/2023 8:24 PM] 5298_
We can discuss any plans you want to share after you make the Twitter, as you can see from Rylan and I's twitter's we are telling the story in the medium of tweets made by someone within the governments of our nations, we expect you would do the same thing


[02/18/2023 8:25 PM] 5298_
I said that to his remark of elections


[02/18/2023 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
COME OUT YE BLACK AND TANS

British Naval Anthem: Heart of Oak
"Heart of Oak" is the official march of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom. It is also the official march of several Commonwealth navies, including the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy. It was also the official march of the Royal Australian Navy, but has now been replaced by the new march, "Royal Australian Navy".

I still find it odd hearing my name in songs of books or anything


[02/18/2023 10:28 PM] 5298_
Even if it's not used as a name


[02/18/2023 10:28 PM] 5298_
Like in the rocky road to Dublin "well in the merry month of May"


[02/18/2023 10:31 PM] 5298_
I wish I knew more about my ancestors from Ireland


[02/18/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We'll be able to find them


[02/18/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_

I don't know how to spell his first name


[02/18/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[02/18/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
He doesn't either


[02/18/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Itll be dominick


[02/18/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but also dominic


[02/18/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im guessing theyre both him


[02/18/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
He spelt it wrong for years and only found it out when my Grandma found his birth certificate


[02/18/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive already potentially found your great grandmother from south dublin


[02/18/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_
Yes, he was born in Dublin, the age is about right and it makes sense he used the wrong name for his marriage in Barrow, the dates also about right because he was quite young when he married

That's my Grandad and Grandma


[02/18/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Potentially


[02/18/2023 10:37 PM] 5298_
It is, how many Dominic Mulveys moved from Dublin to Barrow in the 70's and married a Carol


[02/18/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh no i thought you meant patrick


[02/18/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mulvey


[02/18/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
No, I meant my Grandad. I'll ask my Dad tomorrow who my great grandparents were on my Grandads side


[02/18/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Does he know


[02/18/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
Maybe


[02/18/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
He knows a little about that side of the family


[02/18/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
My Grandad has talked about them but not much


[02/18/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
I'm trying to learn more about Mary Anne Dunphy


[02/18/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
When do you think she was born?


[02/18/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not certain


[02/18/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
1930's definitely


[02/18/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ive found a marriage transcript for a mary dunphy with a patrick myles which could have been misread that way instead of a patrick mulvey, especially with how similar they look


[02/18/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but


[02/18/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
she wouldve been 14


[02/18/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
At the time of my Grandads birth?


[02/18/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
Or at the wedding


[02/18/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[02/18/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wedding


[02/18/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
That's weird


[02/18/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But i also think that maybe we should look for older dominic mulveys because it is a tradition that a mans first born son carries his first name


[02/18/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I'm going to go through the 1956 Irish census and see if I can find my grandad and who his parents were


[02/18/2023 10:51 PM] 5298_
I can't get the census


[02/18/2023 10:51 PM] 5298_
It only goes up to 1911


[02/18/2023 10:53 PM] 5298_
There were 149 Mulveys in county Dublin in 1911

[02/18/2023 11:02 PM] 5298_
Ms. Dunphy is my great grandmother


[02/18/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thought so


[02/18/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its your granddads mothers maiden name


[02/18/2023 11:03 PM] 5298_

How did you find out that it was Mary Anne Dunphy


[02/18/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I did some back tracinv


[02/18/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
tracing


[02/18/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i put dunphy


[02/18/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dublin


[02/18/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and some other shit


[02/18/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it obviously wasnt narrowed down enough


[02/18/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i went on marriage records


[02/18/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
advanced options


[02/18/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
put in mulvey in spouses name


[02/18/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
put dunphy in


[02/18/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and boom


[02/18/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats how i got patrick mulvey


[02/18/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but


[02/18/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont think thats rihgt


[02/18/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because this record is from fucking 1896


[02/18/2023 11:07 PM] 5298_
Definitely not


[02/18/2023 11:08 PM] 5298_
He would be sterile at the time of his son's birth


[02/18/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[02/18/2023 11:10 PM] 5298_
Will the mother's full name be put on birth record or only the maiden name


[02/18/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Only maiden


[02/18/2023 11:10 PM] 5298_
Fuck


[02/18/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive just found something interesting


[02/18/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
could be your great aunty


[02/18/2023 11:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
actually nvm


[02/18/2023 11:11 PM] 5298_
I was going to find my Grandads birth profile and use that to find my great grandmother


[02/18/2023 11:12 PM] 5298_
So I need to find a Ms. Dunphy in Dublin who is married to a Mr. Mulvey and I have no dates except they had a son in 1954


[02/18/2023 11:13 PM] 5298_
I think the marriage will narrow it down and I could find a plausible date


[02/18/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should also look for michael mulveys


[02/18/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and whatever the g is in your granddads name


[02/18/2023 11:16 PM] 5298_
Gordon


[02/18/2023 11:16 PM] 5298_
I'm 90% sure it's Gordon


[02/18/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_
Michael Steven Mulvey, born in February 24th 1981, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria


[02/18/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes i know him


[02/18/2023 11:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I mean someone from ireland called michael mulvey


[02/18/2023 11:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it wouldnt be in his name for no reason


[02/18/2023 11:18 PM] 5298_
I think my dad was named after someone from my Grandma's side


[02/18/2023 11:18 PM] 5298_
It definitely wasn't from Ireland


[02/18/2023 11:19 PM] 5298_
My Grandad hates them, he wouldn't name his son after them


[02/18/2023 11:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh yeah


[02/18/2023 11:22 PM] 5298_
Mary Anne was born in 1896 I believe


[02/18/2023 11:23 PM] 5298_
How do I find the spouse


[02/18/2023 11:24 PM] 5298_
Nm


[02/18/2023 11:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Your grandfather could have been very sinful


[02/18/2023 11:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and never have married but had kids


[02/18/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_
Maybe


[02/18/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_
I'll still look


[02/18/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_
I know they were _very_ Catholic so it isn't likely


[02/18/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_
But he was an alcoholic


[02/18/2023 11:27 PM] 5298_
Patrick Mulvey


[02/18/2023 11:27 PM] 5298_
It must be


[02/18/2023 11:27 PM] 5298_
I've found Mary Anne Dunphy and now I know her husband was Patrick Mulvey

Now to find his parents


[02/18/2023 11:29 PM] 5298_
Well this isn't good


[02/18/2023 11:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wh


[02/18/2023 11:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
y


[02/18/2023 11:29 PM] 5298_
56 candidates


[02/18/2023 11:30 PM] 5298_
They have to be born a while before 1896, that's when he married


[02/18/2023 11:31 PM] 5298_
About half the candidates aren't even called Patrick so that makes things easier


[02/18/2023 11:32 PM] 5298_
I have narrowed it down to two people


[02/18/2023 11:32 PM] 5298_
Both called Patrick Mulvey and both born in Dublin 1877


[02/18/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
Or it could be the ones born in 1882 and 1884


[02/18/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
So it's 4


[02/18/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Does your granddad have like an irish twang to his accent or anything


[02/18/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
A little


[02/18/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Does he just sound british then


[02/18/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
Pretty much


[02/18/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[02/18/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
He's lived here for decades


[02/18/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought he would


[02/18/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but some people seem to think that accents get completely solidified


[02/18/2023 11:34 PM] 5298_
To a British person he sounds Irish and to an Irishman he sounds English


[02/18/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmao


[02/18/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he is in the middle


[02/18/2023 11:34 PM] 5298_
Yeah


[02/18/2023 11:35 PM] 5298_
I think it might be one of the latter two because the former two are born in North Dublin but the latter are born in South Dublin


[02/18/2023 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He wouldve had a baby when he was in his 70s


[02/18/2023 11:36 PM] 5298_
I have narrowed it down to three


[02/18/2023 11:37 PM] 5298_
I'm fucking retarded


[02/18/2023 11:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They mustve married outside of the country for some reason


[02/18/2023 11:37 PM] 5298_
How could Mary and Patrick be married in 1896 but have a kid in 1954

1954

Oh


[02/18/2023 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ask your dad about everything tomorrow


[02/18/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
That's how I can find him, I have three Dominics and if I can narrow down which Dominic it is then I can find my great grandparents


[02/18/2023 11:47 PM] 5298_
He's at his friend's house for the night, I'll see if he's still awake and ask him


[02/18/2023 11:48 PM] 5298_
He's awake


[02/18/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Reece is freaking out because jimmy carter is about to die


[02/18/2023 11:50 PM] 5298_
Of course he is


[02/18/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel bad for him


[02/18/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
It was him


[02/18/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
The G stands for Gerard


[02/18/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Gerard


[02/18/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
His parents are called Timothy and Miara


[02/18/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is wildy different


[02/18/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is a whole key to your family tree


[02/18/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
Near Dublin I, Eire my dad says


[02/18/2023 11:54 PM] 5298_
My grandad spelt his name Dominick but his birth certificate says Dominic


[02/18/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
My Dad has cousins with the name Dunphy


[02/18/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I still cant find a miara dunphy


[02/18/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or a timothy mulvey who married a miara


[02/19/2023 12:00 AM] 5298_
She wasn't called Dunphy I don't think


[02/19/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh shit


[02/19/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yeah i didnt think about that


[02/19/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mary Murphy?


[02/19/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe miara was a nickname?


[02/19/2023 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to take a dna test but its 70 quid


[02/19/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Why would i need the one on the right


[02/19/2023 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if the one on the left is extremely accurate


[02/19/2023 12:14 AM] 5298_

[02/19/2023 12:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
omg


[02/19/2023 12:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Youre finally finding your family


[02/19/2023 12:14 AM] 5298_
I think it's Mary Murphy and Timothy James Mulvey


[02/19/2023 12:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Where does the dunphy name come from


[02/19/2023 12:15 AM] 5298_
My dad told me when my great grandad died and where he died and Timothy James Mulvey fits it


[02/19/2023 12:16 AM] 5298_
Probably a relative married someone with that name


[02/19/2023 12:16 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ah


[02/19/2023 12:18 AM] 5298_
Timothy James Mulvey was born near Dublin in 1925, he married Mary Murphy in 1952 and died in Ulverston, England in 1971. My Great Grandad was born near Dublin in the 1920's, Married someone called Myra and had a kid in 1954 and died in Dalton, England in 1971


[02/19/2023 12:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Myra and miara sound very similar


[02/19/2023 12:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I honestly might buy a dna test


[02/19/2023 12:20 AM] 5298_
I know who my great grandad is now


[02/19/2023 12:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theres still members of the daly family in tyrellspass


[02/19/2023 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They would be very distantly related to me now, but I wonder if they look similar to me


[02/19/2023 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Just like james daly looks exactly like my dad


[02/19/2023 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if reincarnation exists what if my dad is james daly lmfao


[02/19/2023 12:23 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
james daly led 70 men


[02/19/2023 12:23 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i thought it wasnt that many


[02/19/2023 12:26 AM] 5298_
There were 3,254 Mary Murphy's born in Dublin


[02/19/2023 12:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Id love to learn irish but its such a complicated language


[02/19/2023 12:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Draig

[02/19/2023 12:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/19/2023 12:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think it means good day

[02/19/2023 12:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So your great granddad also moved to england


[02/19/2023 12:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i thought he stayed in dublin


[02/19/2023 12:33 AM] 5298_
I think it's because it's the 1991 census data

[02/19/2023 9:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No

Theres no point in asking him because he wont


[02/19/2023 9:51 PM] 5298_
Idea


[02/19/2023 9:52 PM] 5298_
His complete abjection to the notion of sharing his plans, any of them, gives us reasonable suspicion to believe he's up to something


[02/19/2023 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or he just cba making a twitter


[02/19/2023 9:56 PM] 5298_
But we can use that suspicion as a reason to keep a close eye on SW


[02/19/2023 9:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True

Thatcher Song - Irish Anti-Thatcherite Song (Lyrics)
"The Thatcher Song" is an Irish Anti-Thatcherite song about the infamous Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990.

Thousands of kilometers of desert encompass me. Every centimeter containing dozens of grains of sand. The sun exudes her unbearable heat upon me. The sand consumes it and burns my feet as I walk. Great dunes, like waves in a tempest, form the landscape. Water is a long gone luxury to me now. The only way is forward. Or backwards; I can't tell anymore. All I know is the discomfort. My legs ache and my skin blisters at the sweltering force of the sun. 

Salvation can be seen a few miles away but I pin it to mirage. I must keep pushing in whatever direction this is. Water must be just beyond the horizon, I tell myself. That makes no sense, the horizon stays at the same distance. Water will never come, I realize. What if I have become so deluded that mirage masquerades as oasis and oasis masquerades as mirage. Truth becomes lie, lie becomes truth. No matter the power upon me lie and truth must be but what then, if truth becomes lie? Surely I will die in this absurd condition of truths and lies and balance and deceit. 

Thousands of kilometers of desert encompass me. Every centimeter containing dozens of grains of sand. The ground exudes unbearable heat upon me.

It's not about me though. It's specifically my Dad


[02/20/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[02/20/2023 11:48 PM] 5298_
I don't know, I'm just terrified of what life will be like after my Dad dies


[02/20/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel like that too sometimes


[02/20/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and my mum


[02/20/2023 11:48 PM] 5298_
I've never felt that with my mum


[02/20/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why though


[02/20/2023 11:49 PM] 5298_
Obviously I'll be very upset and grieve but I've never had this feeling over her

I've had dreams about life after my dad's death and I wake up crying


[02/20/2023 11:49 PM] 5298_
I've never lost anyone close to me thankfully


[02/20/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Whenever i cry in my dreams i wake up crying but i dont feel sad


[02/20/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its very strange


[02/20/2023 11:50 PM] 5298_
I think it's because I'm a lot closer to my Dad


[02/20/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
I've spent much more time with him and I've talked to him not like a son to a father but between friends. I know his beliefs and his life, we've shared great times together that I haven't with my mum. She's ill so we never get to do anything or have talks much, she's never talked about her life before having me and Danielle or what her beliefs are


[02/20/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Me and my dad talk like father and son but also like friends


[02/20/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont know why i dont see him more often


[02/20/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I go on adventures with both my mum and dad


[02/20/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Although my dad takes me on the best


[02/20/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I love my dad as much as I love my mum, theyre both my parents


[02/20/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
I love them equally but I have more of a connection with my dad


[02/20/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know my mums and my dads beliefs, I know what their life was like before me and my siblings were born


[02/20/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
I want my Dad to know I care about him, I want to tell him that more but I've created this joke over years and it would be odd to get rid of it now


[02/20/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
I always bully him


[02/20/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im sure he takes it as a joke though


[02/20/2023 11:57 PM] 5298_
I call him old, bald, fat, his parents don't love him, no one loves him, I wish he wasn't my dad, I'm waiting for him to die


[02/20/2023 11:57 PM] 5298_
Stuff like that


[02/20/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes im sure he takes it as a joke though


[02/20/2023 11:58 PM] 5298_
He does but it's still nice to tell him he's loved

Imagine how different our discussions would be if i was still a unionist


[02/22/2023 12:15 AM] 5298_
You know that over time we've gotten more left as we've known each other. I wonder if the opposite would happen where we slowly become like fascists

Me discovering james daly and someone i used to speak to like a year back made me support the irish and realise how retarded the union is


[02/22/2023 12:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
before that i thought that the british empire was the best thing to ever happen to history


[02/22/2023 12:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I really want to move to ireland


[02/22/2023 12:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i know for a fact id be bullied for my accent but id do anything if it meant getting away from this shit country


[02/22/2023 12:24 AM] 5298_
I'd develop an Irish accent


[02/22/2023 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Itd be a mixture of a british and irish accent


[02/22/2023 12:25 AM] 5298_
I pronounce quite a few words in a southern way because I've consumed a lot of southern media


[02/22/2023 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my accent is already a tad strange


[02/22/2023 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i noticed that before


[02/22/2023 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you sound really british but sometimes you sound like some irish youtuber i watch


[02/22/2023 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
by really british i mean


[02/22/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
british


[02/22/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not really british


[02/22/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but british


[02/22/2023 12:26 AM] 5298_
It's the IRA songs, I develop a really strong one when singing them


[02/22/2023 12:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think im picking a tiny irish accent up from how many ira songs i listen to


[02/22/2023 12:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like sometimes i say R really hard instead of really soft which is basically it but normally i dont


[02/22/2023 12:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but when i used to watch loads of australian youtubers id sometimes do a slight australian accent without realising


[02/22/2023 12:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its very strange how accents work


[02/22/2023 12:28 AM] 5298_
I think it's an Autistic thing, a trait of autism is mimicking


[02/22/2023 12:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh


[02/22/2023 12:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i just thought it was a normal thing


[02/22/2023 12:29 AM] 5298_
It might be


[02/22/2023 12:29 AM] 5298_
I just know mimicking is an autistic trait


[02/22/2023 12:30 AM] 5298_
I've started doing this weird stim because I've heard Sarah ""tick"" it so many times I've picked it up as a stim


[02/22/2023 12:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have a very strong feeling shes faking tourettes


[02/22/2023 12:30 AM] 5298_
Same


[02/22/2023 12:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe autism and adhd but i cant doubt that she has it


[02/22/2023 12:30 AM] 5298_
I don't think she fakes the ticks


[02/22/2023 12:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think she does


[02/22/2023 12:31 AM] 5298_
I think it's stimming and she doesn't realise it


[02/22/2023 12:31 AM] 5298_
I have it, I just do random things and make random noises because I'm stimming


[02/22/2023 12:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
she seems like one of the twitter users that self diagnose with millions of mental health disorders


[02/22/2023 12:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats my basis


[02/22/2023 12:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
also i do random shit and make random noises but they arent like ticks


[02/22/2023 12:32 AM] 5298_
I think it's a mix of that and actually having somethings


[02/22/2023 12:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
munchausens


[02/22/2023 12:32 AM] 5298_
I think she doesn't know some of the traits she shows are for her autism and then misdiagnoses them as other things

I don't know why it's like that


[02/22/2023 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what


[02/22/2023 12:35 AM] 5298_
Wouldn't it make sense that towns would get more modern as you go out because you're expanding with time?


[02/22/2023 12:35 AM] 5298_
I guess it's to do with classism


[02/22/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It would

The smallest and richest class stays in the small centre while the bigger poorer class get the large circumference


[02/22/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and also because the inner city is richer than outer

I find English really easy but every other language I can't learn

I find welsh to be very similar to english in terms of writing shit


[02/22/2023 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not saying


[02/22/2023 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but writing


[02/22/2023 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but irish has so many complicated rules


[02/22/2023 6:34 PM] 5298_
Obviously I'm fluent in English but I can learn new rules and words pretty much instantly


[02/22/2023 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and scottish


[02/22/2023 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and what puts me off is duolingo is the only real place to learn welsh but duolingo is only for vocabulary and not grammar


[02/22/2023 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it doesnt really teach you grammar just words to use


[02/22/2023 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like it doesnt show you how to change a words tense or anything


[02/22/2023 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
doesnt even show you the alphabet


[02/22/2023 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i think thats really shit

bro is yemen


[02/22/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_

[02/22/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
Exactly


[02/22/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
My gender identity, my self expression, my philosophy, what I want in life, whether or not I even believe I have autism

maybe time will make you more certain


[02/22/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but for now you will be uncertain and that is life


[02/22/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
life is the most uncertain thing there is


[02/22/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
I need a therapist, I need someone to talk to and help me understand myself but I have no idea how I could ever get one


[02/22/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
Life is the most certain thing there is, the self is the most uncertain thing


[02/22/2023 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When i said life i meant your experience of life, not life as a whole


[02/22/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
Ah


[02/22/2023 10:53 PM] 5298_
I can't talk to Mrs. Ashton because I don't trust her


[02/22/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why not


[02/22/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh yeah


[02/22/2023 10:54 PM] 5298_
She's too nice that it's a detriment


[02/22/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i swear if you tell her anything she says she wont tell anyone but then tells everyone


[02/22/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
I feel like if I talked to her about my gender identity that to ""make me feel better"" will ask the teachers to call me May and such when that would just make me never go to school or leave my house  again


[02/22/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmao


[02/22/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I will never trust school


[02/22/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there is nothing they can do to make me trust it


[02/22/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
I could maybe get a professional therapist but if I asked my parents would immediately make me talk to them when I don't want to


[02/22/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
They can't help me and I don't think they want to


[02/22/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If you give it time you will know how you identify, whether you return to a male identity or your female identity sticks or maybe it changes but eventually it will probably be set in stone and therefore would not be as much of an issue as it is now

scottish makes more sense

but welsh can make sense


[02/22/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_
Scottish would be better because if they get independence we could travel the rest of the country without having to go through England

[02/22/2023 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it sounds like a neutral voice with no accent or anything


[02/22/2023 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its so strange


[02/22/2023 11:31 PM] 5298_
It's like the most realistic AI voice, you can tell it sounds human but compared to any normal human it doesn't seem right


[02/22/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
I wonder if I even want a therapist


[02/22/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
Well, particularly if I would want to talk to them


[02/22/2023 11:57 PM] 5298_
You're my closest friend and when I listed the things I'm panicking about I still missed a few things out because I'm embarrassed and I wonder how I'd feel with a stranger

[02/23/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
I shall not live my life in servitude. I owe no debt. I debt not my soul to a God, I debt not my mind, time nor love to anyone or anything. I am free from any shackles and I march not with any creed or banner but beside myself, as the friend of my soul

It's just a broad black brimmer


[02/23/2023 12:19 AM] 5298_
There's a uniform that's hanging in what's known as father's room
A uniform so simple in its style
It has no braid of gold or silk
No hat with feathered plume 
But me mother has preserved it all the while
Me mother made me try it on 
A wish of mine for years
In memory of your father dear she said
And when I put the Sam Browne on she was smiling through her tears
As I placed the broad black brimmer on me head
It's just a broad black brimmer
Ribbons frayed and torn
From the careless whisk of many a mountains breeze
An old trench coat
That's so battle stained and worn
It breaches almost threadbare at the knees
A Sam Browne belt with the buckle big and strong 
And a holster that's been empty many's a day
(But not for long!)
For when men claim Ireland's freedom
The one who'll choose to lead 'em
Will wear the broad black brimmer of the IRA


[02/23/2023 12:20 AM] 5298_

#UFOTwitter This is giant if true. @JChurchRadio "with an extreme amount of confidence" has sources telling him that the James Webb telescope has detected a signature associated with biological intelligent life & that they're 100% convinced about it in Trappist-1.

We're in an economic crisis and every country on the fucking globe is going to be pumping all its money into space exploration and studying and trying to contact this new life


[02/23/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That paves way for revolution


[02/23/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and revolution means reform


[02/23/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and the world will change


[02/23/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
And then what? When has a country not been weak after a revolution? Imagine a planet after several and then an alien race is trying to contact them

the un ambassador in moscow handed the russian government a final note


[02/24/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 oclock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from ukraine


[02/24/2023 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
a state of war would exist between us


[02/24/2023 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received


[02/24/2023 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and that consequently this country is at war with russia


[02/24/2023 12:13 AM] 5298_
Why?


[02/24/2023 12:13 AM] 5298_

Timerio
Timerio is a constructed language based on numbers. It was presented to public in 1921 by the Berlin architect Tiemer as a pure literary language and should be used for automated translations. The idea was, that every concept is assigned by a number. The language shows similarities to the Dewey Decimal Classification by Melvil Dewey.

[02/24/2023 12:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was the last day of school for some reason


[02/24/2023 12:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then i was in form


[02/24/2023 12:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and mr dixon started talking about some film or something


[02/24/2023 12:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then he told me to open this hidden door


[02/24/2023 12:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i did


[02/24/2023 12:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and it opened up this dark hallway with a pipe


[02/24/2023 12:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i walked down it


[02/24/2023 12:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it was really short


[02/24/2023 12:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and he told me to turn the valve


[02/24/2023 12:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i did


[02/24/2023 12:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then it made everyone pass out


[02/24/2023 12:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but me


[02/24/2023 12:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my vision went blue and blurry


[02/24/2023 12:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i could hardly work


[02/24/2023 12:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
walk


[02/24/2023 12:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was like a zombie


[02/24/2023 12:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then i started taking a few steps and felt really light headed


[02/24/2023 12:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then it went back to normal


[02/24/2023 12:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i kept on doing it


[02/24/2023 12:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i passed out the third time


[02/24/2023 12:45 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it went black, then i woke up but thought i was still in a dream then i fell back asleep immediately and it felt like i wasnt passed out

then they realised they werent bombs


[02/24/2023 7:02 PM] 5298_
It's odd that I went to the border between you and SW and immediately started hearing about bombs

Ukraine might be planning to invade Transnistria


[02/24/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant say if thats propaganda or for certain


[02/24/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but the west would surely back the invasion of moldova because its ukraine


[02/24/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/24/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_

It would make no sense for Ukraine to invade Moldova


[02/24/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[02/24/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but also it would make no sense for russia to invade moldova at this moment in time


[02/24/2023 11:09 PM] 5298_
They 100% want to but it wouldn't be very smart to right now


[02/24/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes they want to but they psychically cant


[02/24/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they dont have any fronts near the border and dont have naval superiority near the coast where moldova lies


[02/24/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
moldova is landlocked too so theyd have to get through ukrainian defence


[02/24/2023 11:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would be an expensive operation if they did do it


[02/24/2023 11:11 PM] 5298_
Ukraine might wait until late Spring and then try to push up into Russia. It would be kind of stupid but make a little bit of sense


[02/24/2023 11:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we shouldnt even be sending shit over to ukraine


[02/24/2023 11:13 PM] 5298_
It's for public support

Which is why they want support


[02/24/2023 11:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Surely they can't see it as an insult because for thousands of years they've been calling the mother of Jesus a virgin

I met my Grandad today


[02/25/2023 1:52 AM] 5298_
It turns out I did find my family


[02/25/2023 1:53 AM] 5298_
My Great grandparents are Timmothy James Mulvey and Mary Mulvey


[02/25/2023 1:53 AM] 5298_
Wait


[02/25/2023 1:54 AM] 5298_
When initially asked about Timmothy's middle name my grandad immediately said cunt


[02/25/2023 1:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[02/25/2023 1:54 AM] 5298_
His friend then said "same as his"


[02/25/2023 1:55 AM] 5298_
My grandad literally has a grave marked for his friend


[02/25/2023 1:55 AM] 5298_
He's not dead yet


[02/25/2023 1:56 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/25/2023 1:56 AM] 5298_
Timmothy


[02/25/2023 1:56 AM] 5298_

[02/25/2023 1:57 AM] 5298_
And I am


[02/25/2023 1:58 AM] 5298_
I was going to say something about me killing him but I don't like my auto generations after "my first"


[02/25/2023 1:58 AM] 5298_
"kiss" "time" "ü•á"


[02/25/2023 2:01 AM] 5298_
1. I hardly ever talk about my first kiss
2. I'm a good Christian woman, no sex before marriage ( I've decided I'm not a Christian anymore )
3. I would eat that medal


[02/25/2023 2:01 AM] 5298_
I should sleep


[02/25/2023 2:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What are you even talking about anymore


[02/25/2023 2:01 AM] 5298_
I don't know


[02/25/2023 2:02 AM] 5298_
Eating medals and kisses


[02/25/2023 2:03 AM] 5298_
Funny story, I've done both of those things and somehow the medal is the least surprising

[02/25/2023 2:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there is definitely going to be some form of protest held on monday on the furness peninsula, probably in barrow


[02/25/2023 2:13 AM] 5298_
I want to learn about WW2 in history because I don't know much. I know the main things like Italy becomes  fascist, Germany follows suit, Germany breaks the treaty of Versailles, takes over some countries, then goes for France, the UK declare war, Germany becomes an empire, Japan fucks shit up, Italy pussies out of fascism, Germany makes the stupid mistake of going to Russia, winter, Russia takes Berlin, Hitler blows his brains out, America does America things in Japan, war done


[02/25/2023 2:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I have a prediction but I don't want to know if it's right or wrong


[02/25/2023 7:57 PM] 5298_
I think Dutch is going to keep making bigger and bigger plans and we're going to keep getting bigger and bigger bounties until eventually everyone wants us dead and we do a big heist. Something goes wrong and a lot of people die, Arthur nearly dies and everyone thinks he's dead. Arthur gets a new identity and then it's the prologue

"**North** Walney ( you ) has begun to mobilise their troops. **South** Walney ( Reece ) and the Republic of Furness have forged an alliance"


[02/26/2023 1:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The hand of tension clutches it's grip ever-tighter over the Furness Peninsula. Every passing day, fears of a war breaking out grow stronger. The Furness Peninsula has remained at peace for centuries, but the turn of the new year has threatened it.

South Walney have begun to mobilise their troops. North Walney and the Republic of Furness have forged an alliance to combat the threat. They have reacted to recent news by beginning the mobilisation of their own troops.

War looms over the region, ready to strike.

Of all the trees that grow so fair
Old England to adorn
Greater are none
Beneath the sun
Than Oak and Ash and Thorn
Sing Oak and Ash and Thorn, good sirs
All of a midsummers morn
Surely we sing of no little thing
In Oak and Ash and Thorn

Oak of the clay
Lived many a day
Or ever Aeneas began
Ash of the loam 
Was a lady at home
When Brut was an outlaw man
Thorn of the down 
Saw New Troy town
From which was London born
Witness hereby the ancientry
Of Oak and Ash and Thorn

Sing Oak and Ash and Thorn, good sirs 
All of a midsummers morn
Surely we sing
Of no little thing
In Oak and Ash and Thorn

Yew that is old
In Churchyard mould
He breedeth a mighty bow
Alder for shoes do wise men choose
And beech for cups also
But when ye have killed and ye bowl is spilled 
Your shoes are clean outworn
Back ye must speed
For that ye need 
In Oak and Ash and Thorn

Sing Oak and Ash and Thorn good sirs
All of a midsummers morn
Surely we sing
Of no little thing
In Oak and Ash and Thorn

Ellum, she hates mankind and waits
Till every gust be laid
To drop a limb
On the head of him
That anyway trusts her shade
But whether a lad be sober or sad
Or mellow with ale from the horn
He'll take no wrong 
When he lieth along
'neath Oak and Ash and Thorn 

Sing Oak and Ash and Thorn good sirs
All of a midsummers morn
Surely we sing
Of no little thing
In Oak and Ash and Thorn

Oh, do not tell the priest our plight
Or he would call it a sin
But we've been out in the woods all night
A-conjuring summer in
And we bring you news
By word of mouth
Good news for cattle and corn
Now is the sun 
Come up from the south
With Oak and Ash and Thorn 

Sing Oak and Ash and Thorn good sirs
All of a midsummers morn
England shall bide
Till Judgement Tide
By Oak and Ash and Thorn

English Folk Song - Oak, Ash and Thorn
Oak, Ash and Thorn is an English folk song adapted from Rudyard Kipling's poem 'A Tree Song', which was included in his fantasy book Puck of Pook's Hill. Peter Bellamy set it to music in his album of the same name, the first of many Kipling-inspired albums that would become the signature genre of Bellamy's discography. The poem praises the oak, ...

I'm not announcing this on the Twitter because I can't let Reece know but I'm moving all my troops away from the beaches and using my navy to watch guard. My troops will move up to Dalton ready for an invasion

Okay


[02/26/2023 6:06 PM] 5298_
Immediately I'll take Piel island, that's how the war will be declared. I'll set a fort up at Jubilee Bridge so _if_ you fall I can get rid of the bridge to make crossing harder. You can move down from the north and I'll move up from the south, using Piel island as a naval base and we'll move up, destroying anything in our wake until we meet up in the middle. You can deploy your navy from your west coast to fire at SW's shore line. I'll move into his east coast. We'll have him completely surrounded and hopefully it'll be a quick and easy war


[02/26/2023 6:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that is nearly exactly what happened in the animation lmfao


[02/26/2023 6:08 PM] 5298_
Did it?


[02/26/2023 6:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I invaded from the north, then you took piel island and then went on to invade south end


[02/26/2023 6:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i pushed in from the north, you from the south and then we met near south end where i made south walney surrender


[02/26/2023 6:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I have a question


[02/26/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
When we expand further into the island, taking Cumbria and forming a new Cumberland how will we distribute the land between us or should we unite into one nation


[02/26/2023 10:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
At that point we should unite


[02/26/2023 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should be a federal republic


[02/26/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Check this guys account


[02/26/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
I think this guy immolated a monkey


[02/26/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
I'm 100% serious


[02/26/2023 11:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO WTF


[02/26/2023 11:19 PM] 5298_
I've just watched all his videos and I'm pretty sure it's an ARG


[02/26/2023 11:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probably


[02/26/2023 11:20 PM] 5298_
He's not referring to the month April, April is the monkey because he has a YouTube video of him prowling the woods with a loaded gun screaming for April to come back because she escaped

[02/26/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_
When I Googled it the only thing that came up was Mexican phone numbers


[02/26/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_
So it's probably Spanish

He does start praying


[02/26/2023 11:27 PM] 5298_
It does seem very religious


[02/26/2023 11:27 PM] 5298_
"Dear God"
He starts praying 
The three burning sticks immediately makes me think of the crucifixion


[02/26/2023 11:28 PM] 5298_
And the fact he seemingly immolated a monkey called April. April is the month the crucifixion happened and probably unrelated but Isaac was supposed to be immolated

I'm trying to figure out the bone because I doubt it's a Trilobite

To be fair if he can get hold of a monkey he might also be able to get hold of a Trilobite skeleton

Intruging


[02/26/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_

[02/26/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wait


[02/26/2023 11:58 PM] 5298_
He definitely kidnapped April and they escaped and he sees April as a threat because he brought a loaded gun with him to find them


[02/26/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it cant be anything because binary is 8 digits long i think

[02/27/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats for the letter at least


[02/27/2023 12:01 AM] 5298_
"it's April"


[02/27/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
is that what you got?


[02/27/2023 12:02 AM] 5298_
He says that just before he starts praying


[02/27/2023 12:02 AM] 5298_
He says "and Mama, I love you. It's April. April. April"


[02/27/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
April x 3


[02/27/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
What's in the other bag?


[02/27/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_

[02/27/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What


[02/27/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
Find a prayer that matches the amount of letters on the paper and use that to find the type of encryption


[02/27/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
It has to be religious


[02/27/2023 12:06 AM] 5298_
There's so much to do with God and the crucifixion


[02/27/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
Everything to do with the crucifixion happened in April, the Israelites left Egypt in April, Moses defied God in April, Jericho fell in April, Noah entered the Arc


[02/27/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
Very important Biblical things happened in April


[02/27/2023 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/27/2023 12:12 AM] 5298_
What if April's a prostitute he kidnapped and she fled into the woods? I only think this because April got into his car and "Dear God" with an ominous letter reminds me of "Dear Hell" from Jack the Ripper

Because in between those two videos he has to get into the woods and lose the monkey, both things that happen in the YouTube video


[02/27/2023 12:18 AM] 5298_
I don't think he put the monkey in the bags


[02/27/2023 12:18 AM] 5298_

[02/27/2023 12:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/27/2023 12:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it might give a clue as to encrypton


[02/27/2023 12:20 AM] 5298_
Uh oh


[02/27/2023 12:21 AM] 5298_
You didn't think it was porn when it's called Mrdeepfaked proxyporn?


[02/27/2023 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i just clicked on the link without looking


[02/27/2023 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because im trying to figure it out


[02/27/2023 12:22 AM] 5298_
That website is in no relation, it's probably just using weird things to hide it's illegal porn


[02/27/2023 12:22 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
probably


[02/27/2023 12:22 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/27/2023 12:23 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so unless hes making a very well hidden statement about blacks being monkeys and should die then i doubt they are coordinates


[02/27/2023 12:23 AM] 5298_
At least we've made land


[02/27/2023 12:23 AM] 5298_
He's black himself so probably not


[02/27/2023 12:23 AM] 5298_
Also he's not Nigerian, I'm 90% sure he's Mexican


[02/27/2023 12:23 AM] 5298_
Or at least Latin American


[02/27/2023 12:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i did some more coordinates shit and it took me to pakistan

They speak Spanish which is a plus


[02/27/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He is not latin american lmfao


[02/27/2023 12:27 AM] 5298_
I'm only going with that because I found a comment that said the morse code translates to "Mexican"


[02/27/2023 12:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it doesnt translate to anything

Another account but this one is someone walking the woods and I think they're near something radioactive because of the camera


[02/27/2023 12:48 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
To anybody that's watching this video right now. I just wanted to say I'm sorry and it'll all make sense in due time, so to say. To mama, I love you and to April, April, April. Oh Lord, Father, forgive me for my sins. I have sinned Father, and I repent. I repent, Father. Father, forgive me. Father, forgive me. I repent. I repent. I repent. I repent. I repent.

[02/27/2023 12:53 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and if it is, then its not a common way of encrypting something

Also the feet are different from the first video so I think this is a new person


[02/27/2023 1:01 AM] 5298_
Or April is Pilot, maybe?

Pilate


[02/27/2023 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the man who condemned jesus to die iirc


[02/27/2023 1:02 AM] 5298_
Yeah


[02/27/2023 1:02 AM] 5298_
That's what I meant


[02/27/2023 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
This is about finding April, but it seems to talk about how Jesus died


[02/27/2023 1:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
April is the month that Jesus is expected to have died


[02/27/2023 1:03 AM] 5298_
THABO IS PILATE AND APRIL IS JESUS


[02/27/2023 1:04 AM] 5298_
On the video he prays he says he needs to find April, like Christians find Jesus through prayer and if April is also the monkey then Thabo would be the one bringing April to their death


[02/27/2023 1:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We need to make some detective board shit lmao


[02/27/2023 1:06 AM] 5298_
Who would be Judas Iscariot in this?


[02/27/2023 1:06 AM] 5298_
Maybe Thabo isn't Pilate but Judas instead? Because he's repenting for sending April to die?


[02/27/2023 1:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe he is Judas


[02/27/2023 1:09 AM] 5298_
He's either one of them


[02/27/2023 1:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
April is Jesus


[02/27/2023 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[02/27/2023 1:10 AM] 5298_
What is he saying whilst walking up to the circle of candles?


[02/27/2023 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe the protagonist is Judas, but could also be athiests as a whole


[02/27/2023 1:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

V and the TH in atheism sounds similar


[02/27/2023 1:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think it's Judas, Atheism or someone who is trying to move closer to God


[02/27/2023 1:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because in that youtube video he says "It was big misunderstanding, April"

[02/27/2023 1:25 AM] 5298_
Are we missing a letter?


[02/27/2023 1:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think so


[02/27/2023 1:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
this must be the Parable of the Lost Son


[02/27/2023 1:27 AM] 5298_
Luke 15: 11-32


[02/27/2023 1:27 AM] 5298_
We have CHAPTRV


[02/27/2023 1:27 AM] 5298_
How so?


[02/27/2023 1:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My son,‚Äô the father said, ‚Äòyou are always with me, and everything I have is yours. 32 But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.‚Äô‚Äù


[02/27/2023 1:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe not


[02/27/2023 1:28 AM] 5298_
The Parable of the Prodigal Son has nothing to do with the crucifixion


[02/27/2023 1:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
true


[02/27/2023 1:28 AM] 5298_
I can't help but think about the Tabernacle


[02/27/2023 1:28 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Whys that?


[02/27/2023 1:28 AM] 5298_
Or the Ark of the Covenant


[02/27/2023 1:28 AM] 5298_
The box


[02/27/2023 1:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[02/27/2023 1:29 AM] 5298_
The Tabernacle links with the Last Supper where Judas Iscariot ( who we think Thabo is ) betrayed Jesus and he dies on the cross we know is important to the ARG


[02/27/2023 1:29 AM] 5298_
Wait


[02/27/2023 1:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Also the tabernacle is that thing that the bread to represent the body of jesus goes in


[02/27/2023 1:29 AM] 5298_
Yeah


[02/27/2023 1:30 AM] 5298_
I'm stupid


[02/27/2023 1:30 AM] 5298_
I thought I got the name wrong but I didn't


[02/27/2023 1:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe


[02/27/2023 1:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im not sure


[02/27/2023 1:30 AM] 5298_
The Tabernacle is also the house of Moses but it's also the box the Eucharist goes into

I need to be up in four hours


[02/27/2023 2:36 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am dreading tomorrow


[02/27/2023 2:36 AM] 5298_
You're still awake?


[02/27/2023 2:36 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah I want to sleep tho


[02/27/2023 2:37 AM] 5298_
I've decided I'm doing an all nighter


[02/27/2023 2:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why?


[02/27/2023 2:39 AM] 5298_
Because if I sleep now then all I'll want to do in 4 hours when I'm awake is sleep but if I stay awake I'll be in that weird mellow state and school might be a bit more bearable


[02/27/2023 2:40 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Maybe i have to go back further than that


[03/01/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What if the newly formed german empire decided against creating the central powers with austria


[03/01/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
austria only wanted to be in a faction because they were a new but extremely strong empire and were scared another war could happen between them


[03/01/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so what if the germans chose the entente instead of asutria


[03/01/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
austria


[03/01/2023 10:01 PM] 5298_
What if France won the Franco-Prussian war


[03/01/2023 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
another alternate timeline


[03/01/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But i want this one to be where austria and italy still form the triple alliance without germany


[03/01/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
world war 1 still happens but isnt nearly as disastrous


[03/01/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or the austrians collapse


[03/01/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats my idea


[03/01/2023 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Germany chooses the Brits over the Austrians, the French still despise them though. The Austrians still form their alliance with Italy, though excluding Germany and not really a triple alliance. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand still happens, leading to a smaller scale European War. The Austria part of Austria is divided, because Austrians and the people of the Sudetenland are ethnically German. This leads to a civil war during World War 1 in Austria where there are Pro-Entente members and Pro-Alliance members. As the Austrians split, rebel groups seize the opportunity and join in on the war.


[03/01/2023 10:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The Entente may not exist in this timeline as we know it


[03/01/2023 10:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The entente was formed as a response to the formation of the Central Powers and the threat of specifically Germany


[03/01/2023 10:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in fact, world war 1 may have been against the french


[03/01/2023 10:23 PM] 5298_
YEAAAAAHHHHHHH FUCK THE FRENCH


[03/01/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[03/01/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just made 3 pancakes


[03/01/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my brother was making them then i watched him make them so i had some understanding then he showed me the amount of oil and shit to put in so i copied that and the rest was just me waiting for it to cook


[03/01/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i did have to ask him how long to wait to flip but overall they turned out pretty well


[03/01/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the last one tho is like what happens when you abort a fetus but you still give birth to them and they have to live a life of extreme disability


[03/01/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
Fucking what


[03/01/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was a very sad pancake


[03/01/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its in bits but the other 2 are fine


[03/01/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
I want to be able to control when I laugh


[03/01/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao


[03/01/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
I would go up to random people in the street and say in the most Autistic voice ever "I'm retarded, AUGHUUGHAAAUGG" and then just go stone faced and walk away


[03/01/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i do that sorta shit already when im out lmfao


[03/01/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
one time there was some crackhead woman outside of morrisons with her kid and she was on the phone then will hunt pushed me into her


[03/01/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then in the most crackhead voice and with a lisp she said


[03/01/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"DICHSHUHEAHD" (Dickhead for normal english speakers)


[03/01/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
Take that kid away from her


[03/01/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
I want to make stupid noises at old people and watch their faith in humanity leave

[03/01/2023 10:51 PM] 5298_
I act far more retarded at home than in school it's insane


[03/01/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i used to be more like you in terms of personality but i became super retarded mode because of lockdown


[03/01/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was still similar to how i am now in terms of me not being able to concentrate or keep still or shit but it wasnt as bad as it is now


[03/01/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and its lockdowns fault


[03/01/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
being locked inside for months fucked me up and i started getting really paranoid that there were people and monsters hiding in the corners of my room and they were gonna kill me or something like that


[03/01/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i wasnt that way before it


[03/01/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i literally went insane


[03/01/2023 10:54 PM] 5298_
I act more retarded when I'm with my friends because I'm more confident. I was actually confident then I would be a lot like you


[03/01/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I used to have a lot of confidence


[03/01/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like much more than i do now


[03/01/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i used to be more like a leader than i am now


[03/01/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i used to want to lead everything but now i dont


[03/01/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lockdown did that to me


[03/01/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it stripped me of my confidence and any social skills i had formed


[03/01/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im slowly recovering i think


[03/01/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im started to find it a bit easier to work than for example last year or even a few months ago


[03/01/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i still struggle


[03/01/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
I was shocked on Tuesday how attentive you were in the hall


[03/01/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was fascinated


[03/01/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my fucking legs killed and i kept shuffling


[03/01/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i loved the documentary


[03/01/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i love nature


[03/01/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
Same, somehow my sisters hated it


[03/01/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and that kept me watching


[03/01/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
even when i did lose attention it wasnt hard for me to gain it again


[03/01/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
I'm going to watch the rest of it


[03/01/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm a lot calmer at home because I have the freedom to do whatever i want


[03/01/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but at school when im trapped for 6 hours a day it all goes to shit


[03/01/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nothing is physically stopping me from fucking off


[03/01/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i dont like attention from loads of people and i dont want to cause myself loads of shit in the future


[03/01/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
I don't have to worry about being bullied at home so I can act like myself


[03/01/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just want school to fuck off


[03/01/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to get out more


[03/01/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to stop being nervous again


[03/01/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am still paranoid about everything


[03/01/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had a lot of fears before lockdown but it just amplified them


[03/01/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
I was so close to leaving Science today because I wanted to go look at the cherry blossom tree


[03/01/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like exploring but im scared someone will kill me because im alone in the woods


[03/01/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that tree always blooms first


[03/01/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i noticed it last year and the year before that


[03/01/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/01/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the trees are blooming earlier this year it seems tho


[03/01/2023 11:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/01/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
Climate change


[03/01/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/01/2023 11:08 PM] 5298_
I usually know the answers but I don't answer because I can't be arsed and teachers usually can't hear me but I've started getting sick of no one answering questions so we just wait for ages so I'm answering more so we can actually do shit

[03/01/2023 11:41 PM] 5298_
What phrase?


[03/01/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oak and ash and thorn


[03/01/2023 11:41 PM] 5298_
It's a great song


[03/01/2023 11:42 PM] 5298_
English Folk music and tradition makes me proud of England, and then the rest of it ignites a passion for violent terrorism against Westminster


[03/01/2023 11:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the us is probably gonna ban tiktok


[03/01/2023 11:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and china isnt happy obviously


[03/01/2023 11:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because tiktok is spyware


[03/01/2023 11:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i dont give a shit


[03/01/2023 11:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i only feel pride for the old england before all the german people came over and created modern england


[03/01/2023 11:43 PM] 5298_

I just woke up from a dream I was stabbed


[03/02/2023 1:44 AM] 5298_
I could feel the knife penetrate my skin and organs, the cold metal tearing through me and the blood pooling out of me. It was terrible


[03/02/2023 4:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
omg


[03/02/2023 4:46 PM] 5298_
I died last night


[03/02/2023 4:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Doubt it


[03/02/2023 4:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
tbh


[03/02/2023 4:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i thought something happened too


[03/02/2023 4:46 PM] 5298_
I'm convinced


[03/02/2023 4:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when i was watching youtube my vision started to distort and zoom out


[03/02/2023 4:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what if we keep switching timeline together lmfao


[03/02/2023 4:48 PM] 5298_
I dreamt about dying and then I came to school and suddenly I was the only person that remembered having John Muir first period Thursday week A but today it was second period


[03/02/2023 4:48 PM] 5298_
Everyone remembered that it was second period


[03/02/2023 4:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Either they or you just got it confused, maybe its second period week b? or you did switch timeline and either i followed or you are from another timeline and you just fucking merged with yourself


[03/02/2023 4:49 PM] 5298_
I am 100% convinced I have switched timeline, I don't know how but it happened


[03/02/2023 4:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
has anything else suddenly changed


[03/02/2023 4:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe it wasnt a dream


[03/02/2023 4:50 PM] 5298_
Sarah always goes early and Sir seemed to be confused when she did


[03/02/2023 4:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao i thought that was strange too


[03/02/2023 4:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if anyone switched timeline it was us 2


[03/02/2023 4:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if we both switched timeline then that means we're the same entity in 2 different bodies


[03/02/2023 4:51 PM] 5298_
Also people kept saying my eyes are blue; they aren't they're green


[03/02/2023 4:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My eyes are also green


[03/02/2023 4:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I made isabel cry


[03/02/2023 4:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao


[03/02/2023 4:52 PM] 5298_
Is that why we're so similar


[03/02/2023 4:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then mrs whittam said the generic teacher shit


[03/02/2023 4:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe


[03/02/2023 4:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then i said well you may see it as bullying but i see it as "banter" and while you probably see it differently thats how ive always seen it and probably always will


[03/02/2023 4:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was more of a back and forth thing where we'd both say stuff to eacher


[03/02/2023 4:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
eacher?


[03/02/2023 4:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
eachother


[03/02/2023 4:53 PM] 5298_

[03/02/2023 4:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 4:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my eyes are pretty green


[03/02/2023 4:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 4:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They are blue


[03/02/2023 4:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i disagree with this statement now


[03/02/2023 4:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i pictured you with green eyes and it looked strange


[03/02/2023 4:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 5:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
how does it feel to be in a new timeline


[03/02/2023 5:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if planet nine exists its most likely the fifth giant


[03/02/2023 5:04 PM] 5298_
Odd


[03/02/2023 5:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
bro if you are really may from a different timeline what else have you noticed that seems off


[03/02/2023 5:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im very interested


[03/02/2023 5:08 PM] 5298_
Nothing I would put down to switching time line


[03/02/2023 5:08 PM] 5298_
Just stuff I've learned I didn't expect, like that my cousins gay

[03/02/2023 5:15 PM] 5298_
I'm 100% convinced I switched time lines


[03/02/2023 5:15 PM] 5298_
There is not an ounce of hyperbole in that sentence

[03/02/2023 6:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 6:43 PM] 5298_
No idea


[03/02/2023 6:43 PM] 5298_
I literally just blacked out for 10 minutes


[03/02/2023 6:44 PM] 5298_
It's not sleep deprivation is it


[03/02/2023 6:44 PM] 5298_
I felt the most isolated I have ever felt last night


[03/02/2023 6:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 6:47 PM] 5298_
I was laying in bed and everyone was offline and the only sound I could hear was the distance quacking of a gaggle of ducks. I felt so alone, it was as if I was the only person awake in the world

I've had an idea for years but I've always procrastinated on it but I want to actually start it


[03/02/2023 7:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What is that


[03/02/2023 7:02 PM] 5298_
I want to make a book series, now I realise it's kind of similar to The Lord of the Rings but when I first thought about this I didn't even know who Tolkien was


[03/02/2023 7:03 PM] 5298_
It's not that similar it's just like most other fantasy books but I just like The Lord of the Rings


[03/02/2023 7:03 PM] 5298_
And I want to put the care, love and thought into it that Tolkien did with Middle-Earth


[03/02/2023 7:23 PM] 5298_
I just realised this is literally just the fucking Hobbit


[03/02/2023 7:24 PM] 5298_
"A great Leviathan has made an important city its nest and through mystical means our commonfolk hero is whisked away on a fantastical journey to drive away the beast" that's literally the Hobbit


[03/02/2023 7:25 PM] 5298_

[03/02/2023 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

ireland


[03/02/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
do you reckon that ww1 helped the ira?


[03/02/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or not


[03/02/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might have to leave ireland, or i might make it but have it much smaller because in this timeline the british would be a hyperpower at this point


[03/02/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
this is the 1930s map


[03/02/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh and sardinia and corsica and sicily


[03/02/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
forgot about them


[03/02/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill free them all


[03/02/2023 7:34 PM] 5298_
No, it sent countless Irish men to die for Britain, many of which were IRA or sympathisers as we see in the case of the Connaught Rangers


[03/02/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought that


[03/02/2023 7:34 PM] 5298_
The only thing I could find is Breton nationalism


[03/02/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure whether i should make own all of ireland, everything but northern ireland, make it like 50/50 or just leave it


[03/02/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i thought so


[03/02/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill give them all of ireland


[03/02/2023 7:35 PM] 5298_
That's why IRA refuses to wear the poppies for Remembrance


[03/02/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i havent worn a poppy for remembrance in years


[03/02/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why do i always see maps of ireland owning the isle of mann


[03/02/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
man


[03/02/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fuck i always put mann because i swear it used to be called man


[03/02/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mann


[03/02/2023 7:36 PM] 5298_
Mann


[03/02/2023 7:36 PM] 5298_
It's only called Man because of England


[03/02/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Alright


[03/02/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
why do i always see maps where ireland owns mann though


[03/02/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 7:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like that mrs pharoah also hates communism


[03/02/2023 7:43 PM] 5298_
Oh yeah, what was that about?


[03/02/2023 7:43 PM] 5298_
I just heard her talking about The Communist Manifesto


[03/02/2023 7:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i told her that i keep seeing people glorifying communism from western countries who have no idea how many people communism killed and that those same people would likely die from it


[03/02/2023 7:44 PM] 5298_
Communism is the worst system ever proposed ever, it's worse than Capitalism


[03/02/2023 7:45 PM] 5298_
And you know how left I am, Socialism is the best system we've got but Communism is actually so retarded


[03/02/2023 7:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just realised that even though fascism never came to be in this timeline, france would most likely end up with an ideology similar to nazism


[03/02/2023 7:46 PM] 5298_
Probably


[03/02/2023 7:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am tempted to give the northern coast to the brits because of you know but i might just make it a british occupation zone, similar to the rhineland was


[03/02/2023 7:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
actually


[03/02/2023 7:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the rhineland wasnt an occupation zone


[03/02/2023 7:46 PM] 5298_
I think most of Europe was becoming Fascist at that point, Germany just took the first step and then everyone backed down, except for the fucking Italians of course


[03/02/2023 7:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was a demilitarised zone


[03/02/2023 7:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao


[03/02/2023 7:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i meant the saarland but bigger


[03/02/2023 7:49 PM] 5298_
Literally the first suggestion

[03/02/2023 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What do you think of the alternate timeline thingy then


[03/02/2023 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
how plausible is it


[03/02/2023 8:34 PM] 5298_
Very interesting


[03/02/2023 8:35 PM] 5298_
From my limited understanding of Europe in the 30's it seems plausible


[03/02/2023 8:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont know what to call this timeline


[03/02/2023 8:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was thinking pax europa but almost every alternate history thing uses that fucking naming system now


[03/02/2023 8:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 8:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 8:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I hate the british but the falklands arent argentinian


[03/02/2023 8:54 PM] 5298_
Why does every piece of land have to be owned


[03/02/2023 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because the world decided it to be that way


[03/02/2023 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the argentinians dont have a real claim to the islands other than the fact that theyre close


[03/02/2023 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
spain could probably claim them but they didnt hold them for long and didnt give them to their argentinian colony

[03/02/2023 8:57 PM] 5298_
I wish we had something like that here. I would found a colony and see if I can do any better than England which isn't hard, I just have to not kill countless innocent and steal previous artifacts from counties I also stole to steal people and resources


[03/02/2023 8:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/02/2023 8:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Welsh Patriotic Song: Yma o Hyd
The Welsh are the real British people. Aka Britons, they were the original inhabitants of Britain. I first heard this song from a documentary some years ago...

üßµWe have replaced the original Northern Ireland Protocol and announced the new Windsor Framework.  

What's changed? Firstly, the Green Lane  

‚ùå Before: Lengthy paperwork  
‚úÖ Now: Simple digital declaration  

We‚Äôve removed any sense of a border in the Irish Sea.

[03/03/2023 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im guessing the rune style came from the vikings


[03/03/2023 7:22 PM] 5298_
That's why it's called the Alphabet, Alpha-bet(a)


[03/03/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i wonder what the irish alphabet would look like if they were left to their own devices, and were never invaded by anyone


[03/03/2023 7:24 PM] 5298_
Was Ireland invaded by anyone before Englaland and Alba?


[03/03/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The vikings


[03/03/2023 7:28 PM] 5298_
Did they? It would make sense but I thought like the Romans they stopped at Englaland. I know they invaded around York in England


[03/03/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dublin was founded by the vikings


[03/03/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

were founded by the vikings

excluding galway


[03/03/2023 7:31 PM] 5298_
Limerick seems odd to invade, wouldn't you invade a surrounding area, or up in Ulster or down in Munster


[03/03/2023 7:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They didnt invade them, they *founded* the cities

Your jar of Virginny 
Will cost you a guinea
Which you reckon too much
By five shillings or ten
But light your Churchwarden
And judge it according 
When I've told you the troubles of poor honest men

From the capes of the Delaware
As you are well aware
We sail with tobacco
For England but then
Our own British cruisers
They watch us come through sirs
And they press half a score of these poor honest men

Or if by quick sailing 
Thick weather prevailing 
We leave them behind 
As we do now and then
We're sure of a gun
From each friggat we run from
Which is often destruction for us poor honest men

Broadsides the Atlantic 
We tumble short handed
With shot holes to plug and new canvas to bend
And of the Azures
Dutch, Dons and Monsieurs
Awaiting to terrify poor honest men

Napoleons embargo 
Is laid on all cargo
Which comforts to aid King George may intend
Since roll twist and leaf
All comforts to cheif
They try for to steal it from poor honest men

With no heart for fight
We take refuge in flight 
But fire as we run
Our retreat to defend
Until our stern chasers
Cut up her fore-brasers 
And she flies up the wind from us poor honest men

The other night, my vision distorted weirdly but it was short lived


[03/04/2023 12:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Last night, i felt a sharp pain in my lower abdomen and my leg, it felt tight and they appeared at exactly the same time and not long after the pain felt like it went to my heart and then i just thought it was normal so i didnt think anything of it but i started sweating profusely, my head felt really light and then my vision kept on zooming in and out and moving all over and i felt really disoriented


[03/04/2023 12:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe it was a random panic attack but maybe it wasnt


[03/04/2023 12:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then when i was trying to sleep every so often i felt like a force was dragging my soul out of my body then id realise and id feel like i got sucked back in


[03/04/2023 12:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think i have brain damage


[03/04/2023 12:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/04/2023 2:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i want to make a welsh-german hybrid language


[03/04/2023 2:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I've made one word


[03/04/2023 2:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Twe for I (pronounced t-ve)


[03/04/2023 2:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dw I means I am


[03/04/2023 2:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In English, the German T can get dropped in favour for the letter D


[03/04/2023 2:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wait i forgor mutations in welsh


[03/04/2023 2:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I is FI


[03/04/2023 2:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
let me remake that word


[03/04/2023 2:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wie


[03/04/2023 2:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
even tho that is what in german


[03/04/2023 2:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fi is the welsh word for I


[03/04/2023 2:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Which is pronounced Vee


[03/04/2023 2:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
HOLY SHIT 4 WORDS

For the most part


[03/04/2023 3:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
german grammar is similar to english but gets confusing in questions


[03/04/2023 3:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Question word first, so like in english, then the verb, then the subject

[03/04/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
On the 30 June 20, I with private Patrick Kelly, were detailed to go to Solon in the Similar hills to communicate the fact that the troops in Jullundur had mutinied and to give the reason for the mutiny and to give instructions also that the mutiny, if they did mutiny, would be on the lines of passive resistance with no violence. I appealed to James Joseph Daly whom I approached as the most competent man and whom I knew personally wished to carry out an effort to start a mutiny. Daly, I knew, was inclined to the republican movement in Ireland.

J J Daly, I'm guessing is James Joseph Daly was shot but J Daly was only given 3 years in prison


[03/04/2023 9:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
J daly?


[03/04/2023 9:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Its either william or james


[03/04/2023 9:44 PM] 5298_
James J is already written down and it's not likely it's William


[03/04/2023 9:44 PM] 5298_

[03/04/2023 10:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
1916:

April 25th: France announces that Germany must hand Alsace-Lorraine over to them immediately, or the consequences shall be felt for decades.

May 3rd: Explosion near the Palais Bourbon kills 19, France blames the attack on Germany

May 7th: Explosion in Rome kills 12, Italy then blames the attack on Germany

May 16th, 1916: France, Italy and Austria declare war on Germany and Britain.


[03/04/2023 10:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
does that sound reasonable?

[03/04/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/04/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Should I have russia in the alliance too?


[03/04/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it makes a lot of sense


[03/04/2023 10:16 PM] 5298_
Why would Wilhelm form an alliance with Britain? Maybe he thought he could use them to build his empire


[03/04/2023 10:16 PM] 5298_
The Familial Alliance


[03/04/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[03/04/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because in this timeline, the Germans don't forgive the Austrians for the war 5 years earlier and decided they do want to build their empire and influence and so they turn to Britain


[03/04/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Britain is hesitant at first, but realise that an alliance would be great for both sides, when it comes to building power and influence


[03/04/2023 10:18 PM] 5298_
Invasion of Austria-Hungary?


[03/04/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Along with that, the Britons and British Royal Family stem from the Germans

Austro-Prussian War


[03/04/2023 10:18 PM] 5298_
I mean in your timeline


[03/04/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No, the French attempt to invade Germany, Belgium and probably the Netherlands to fulfill the Natural Border claim


[03/04/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
France doesn't support the idea of a Familial Alliance at all, and decide that since Britain is not letting the offer down they would cut ties with Britain in immediate effect


[03/04/2023 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
This starts a sort of cold war scenario between the Familial Alliance and the French

You've made me want to make an alternate time line where either William the Bastard never comes to Englaland or Godwinson wins

The mutual hatred of this timelines "entente" between Austria-Hungary, Italy and France allows them to put their differences aside and they form their own triple alliance


[03/04/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nothing too major happens for a while, but tensions mount and threats keep coming for decades


[03/04/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In 1912, a gunman assassinates the Leader of France, Frances blames this on the Familial Alliance, but decide against war for now however they would use this as one of their justifications for war in the future


[03/04/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i might change that bit


[03/04/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In 1913, France begins amassing a lot of troops along the Marginot Line and the Belgian Border


[03/04/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not long after, they notice the same with Italy and Austria


[03/04/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Taking this as a threat, the Familial alliance begins sending their own men to the border, now tensions are at the highest level since the Crimean War and rapidly rising


[03/04/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im not sure what to do for 1914


[03/04/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and 1915


[03/04/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Other than tension keeps rising


[03/04/2023 10:27 PM] 5298_
Tensions can only get so high, you need a catalyst


[03/04/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
true


[03/04/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
On April 25th 1916, the French demand Alsace-Lorraine, stating that if the demands of the ultimatum are not met, the consequences would be felt for decades.


[03/04/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A week later, on May 3rd, an explosion rings out in Paris near the Palais Bourbon which killed 19. France blamed the attack on the Germans.


[03/04/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And just days later, another explosion in Rome killed 12. Italy claims the Germans also did this attack, however people are sceptical.


[03/04/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
On May 16th, 1916, the "Cental Powers" would declare war on the Familial Alliance, sparking the Great War.


[03/04/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want the war to be long and drawn out like world war 1


[03/04/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
Isn't it odd that as technology has gotten better wars have gotten longer


[03/04/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What a surprise


[03/04/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
During the war, france would be stuck in a stalemate similar to world war 1


[03/04/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
italy would be losing the north and austria hungary fell into civil war


[03/04/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the soviets never rose to power


[03/04/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

There's a girl I like, who per request of anonymity I will call S, but I feel like there's a disconnection almost between us, she likes me too but when we hang out it's like she's closed off. I don't know if I even like her anymore if I just like liking someone or like who she used to be. I don't know if I should see if things work out or end things

but what happened was strange as shit


[03/05/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
especially the feeling of being dragged out of my body then pushed back in multiple times


[03/05/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it felt like I was dragged out, then i went weightless before being pushed back in


[03/05/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
some weird shit has been going on recently tho


[03/05/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like when i closed my eyes and i knew they were closed but i could see everything that was going on outside of them


[03/05/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and my vision looked like it was splitting into 3 layers


[03/05/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

It is


[03/05/2023 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i can tell from the letters


[03/05/2023 12:25 AM] 5298_
I used to know how to tell Japanese, Mandarin and Korean apart but I'm worse at it now


[03/05/2023 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
especially the last one


[03/05/2023 12:25 AM] 5298_
I'm actually amazing


[03/05/2023 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mandarin is literally squares


[03/05/2023 12:25 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
all the letters are contained within a square, and then they have shit attached to them sometimes


[03/05/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
japanese has similar letters to that in the one offshoot of the language


[03/05/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
korean doesnt have very square letters


[03/05/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyre like japanese but more bold


[03/05/2023 12:26 AM] 5298_
I should learn how to tell the Slavic languages apart


[03/05/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theyre all very similar


[03/05/2023 12:26 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like very very similar


[03/05/2023 12:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not like germanic languages where theyre quite easy to tell apart


[03/05/2023 12:27 AM] 5298_
Well that was nearly terrible


[03/05/2023 12:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what

[03/05/2023 12:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
romanian?


[03/05/2023 12:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 12:29 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
romanian is a slavic language with a latin alphabet

It doesn't look Romanian, same colours but wrong shape and where did the white come from

its very satisfying to watch


[03/05/2023 12:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I need to slow the offensive down now


[03/05/2023 12:38 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the west front will take a break soon and the south front will follow not long after


[03/05/2023 12:46 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I make it every other day so it makes more sense to why the attacks are so fast


[03/05/2023 12:49 AM] 5298_
Out of curiosity, why did you say Lilly?


[03/05/2023 12:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

thats my worst nightmare


[03/05/2023 1:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it always feels awkward trying to talk people out of shit


[03/05/2023 1:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like "everyone likes you!!11 hang in there"!!11!1!1"


[03/05/2023 1:12 AM] 5298_
When I was like 11 a friend messaged me that he tried to kill himself


[03/05/2023 1:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When i was 9 i tried to kill myself cause of fortnite


[03/05/2023 1:13 AM] 5298_
I'm wheezing


[03/05/2023 1:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i picked up a knife and i tried to stab myself but my mum saw me and screamed and took it off me


[03/05/2023 1:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was literally in the middle of thrusting it down into my wrist but she took it off me


[03/05/2023 1:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was like a centimetre away from penetrating my wrist


[03/05/2023 1:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was completely ready to die


[03/05/2023 1:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i died in fortnite, i died in real life


[03/05/2023 1:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
bit realistic if you ask me


[03/05/2023 1:14 AM] 5298_
The worst one was when I was younger I had a break up message and she told me that she had self harmed over me. I still haven't gotten over that


[03/05/2023 1:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
damn

What colours mean what, I can tell red is the "entente" and blue is the Familial Alliance but what about the others


[03/05/2023 3:26 PM] 5298_
Is light blue neutral?


[03/05/2023 3:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
light blue is occupied land


[03/05/2023 3:27 PM] 5298_
Oh


[03/05/2023 3:27 PM] 5298_
Who occupies Greece?


[03/05/2023 3:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 3:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 3:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 3:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 3:33 PM] 5298_
If Germany could invade Austria they would have a good position, they could push into any of the Entente through the Alps


[03/05/2023 3:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not really


[03/05/2023 3:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would be far too expensive and theyre actually at a disadvantage because the alps are only really slopes in the territory so austria has the high ground

[03/05/2023 8:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We should (x2)


[03/05/2023 8:19 PM] 5298_

The concert was awful


[03/05/2023 10:01 PM] 5298_
The ""singing"" was ear-splitting, the guitarists kept fucking up, I'm pretty sure the drummer was highly disabled and all the songs were shit anyways

[03/05/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
I wouldn't do an art club because it seems restrictive, I wouldn't do a music club because I refuse to do a show, maybe a net game because I like them but I don't think I'd meet anyone


[03/05/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly

most clubs that are for expression dont let you express your thoughts


[03/05/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_
I need to get out and meet people though because I'm developing agoraphobia. I'm already terrified of leaving the house but it's not that debilitating yet


[03/05/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
To start whenever says hi or alright to you just say it back


[03/05/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then if they start a conversation try go from there


[03/05/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_
I'm so socially awkward it's awful


[03/05/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im still very socially awkward but im slowly getting better


[03/05/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
I had no friends last summer


[03/05/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
I spent the whole time alone


[03/05/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
last summer me lucus and cole were doing parkour down the docks


[03/05/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
6 weeks of isolation on the verge of heat stroke


[03/05/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and we were prank calling chinese restaurants in blackpool lmfao


[03/05/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i didnt know what to say so i just fucking put on a chinese accent and it was dead awkward


[03/05/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then we nearly got lost in some really tall grass after we jumped from the pipes


[03/05/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then we came across a dead rabbit under a tree


[03/05/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then we kept walking till we got out


[03/05/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and in town we kept on going up the multi and throwing shopping carts and stuff off the top


[03/05/2023 10:49 PM] 5298_
I went to Wales which was alright but a girl tried to talk to me and I had a panic attack and cried alone behind a caravan


[03/05/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then we lobbed a cone off it


[03/05/2023 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I was in the arcade in the caravan park and a girl came up to the machine I was at and said hi and asked my name and just general stuff and I said hi and that I'm Dylan and then I left and cried behind a caravan


[03/05/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that sounds very upsetting


[03/05/2023 10:54 PM] 5298_
I wanted the Earth to swallow me up


[03/05/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
Yeah


[03/05/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why did that even happen


[03/05/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nowadays making a 9/11 joke is the norm


[03/05/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
I had a very dark sense of humour and my dad said I shouldn't in school because it would upset someone so I did the complete opposite


[03/05/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I can't breathe when I'm lying down


[03/05/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
When I try and take deep breaths it feels like something is pressing against my lungs


[03/05/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_

[03/05/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/05/2023 11:34 PM] 5298_
I think I'm dying


[03/05/2023 11:34 PM] 5298_
Everytime


[03/05/2023 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Normally it's whenever I've had a fizzy drink like I did before so it might just be gas buildup but idk cause even then it happens when I don't drink anything fizzy

[03/05/2023 11:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

What


[03/07/2023 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
how people think that may means permission and that can soley means ability


[03/07/2023 6:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
can can be used to ask for permission while also being used to express ability


[03/07/2023 6:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it seems to be a very common misconception


[03/07/2023 6:47 PM] 5298_

Yeah, Edward was from Munster and I'm 99% sure James was from Connaught, considering he was a Connaught Ranger


[03/07/2023 7:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he was from county galway


[03/07/2023 7:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he joined the connaught rangers tho


[03/07/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
edward daly


[03/07/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/07/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/07/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/07/2023 7:18 PM] 5298_
County Galway is in Connaught


[03/07/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
both obviously supported irish republicanism


[03/07/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats why its the connaught rangers


[03/07/2023 7:19 PM] 5298_
Am I having a stroke


[03/07/2023 7:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/07/2023 7:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
both from connaught


[03/07/2023 7:20 PM] 5298_
It just seemed that you saying he was from County Galway was juxtaposed with the presumption he was from Connaught


[03/07/2023 7:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i forgor that galway was in connaught


[03/07/2023 7:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what happened


[03/07/2023 7:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
even tho he was in the connaught rangers


[03/07/2023 7:20 PM] 5298_
Ah


[03/07/2023 7:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe theyre related but probably not


[03/07/2023 7:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lots of similarities though


[03/07/2023 7:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
down to the last name


[03/07/2023 7:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Edward was the youngest commander and the youngest man to be executed at the Easter Rising


[03/07/2023 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they were both young when they were executed


[03/07/2023 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
very very young


[03/07/2023 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im certain james daly fought in ww1


[03/07/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

ive read that daly joined in ww1 and fought in ww1


[03/07/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
probably around the time of the easter risings


[03/07/2023 7:23 PM] 5298_
He might have been a part of a different regiment


[03/07/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i read it was the connaught rangers


[03/07/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill look around


[03/07/2023 7:23 PM] 5298_
And after the war moved to the Connaught Rangers


[03/07/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
At the outbreak of war in 1914 his father and three brothers joined the army, and Daly later ran away to do likewise, lying about his age to enlist.


[03/07/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Daly's elder brother William was initially involved in this protest but later abandoned it.


[03/07/2023 7:24 PM] 5298_
J Daly can't have been William then


[03/07/2023 7:25 PM] 5298_
If Willian was old enough to enlist by 1919, unless he wasn't old enough in 1914


[03/07/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
william was james dalys older brother


[03/07/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
1897 he was born


[03/07/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
these are all the dalys

So he was old enough to enlist in 1914


[03/07/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im not certain if all of them are absolutely accurate, specifically frank and bridie


[03/07/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes he was


[03/07/2023 7:26 PM] 5298_
Who was J Daly then


[03/07/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not a mystery


[03/07/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its either a connaught ranger who was coincidentally named that or they changed their mind about what to do with james daly


[03/07/2023 7:28 PM] 5298_
I doubt the main mutineer would be in question whether or not to execute and his sentence was ticked, not crossed out. It might be a coincidence


[03/07/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It might be james dalys dad


[03/07/2023 7:29 PM] 5298_
Maybe


[03/07/2023 7:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
both were called james daly, both in the rangers


[03/07/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
also his brothers were in the connaught rangers


[03/07/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fucking hell


[03/07/2023 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just learned the connaught rangers 2nd battalion made its a long way to tipperary


[03/07/2023 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"On August 13, 1914, the Irish regiment, the Connaught Rangers, sang "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" as they marched through Boulogne. This scene, observed by Daily Mail correspondent George Curnock, was reported on 18th of August 1914. This song has been associated with the First World War ever since."


[03/07/2023 7:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/08/2023 6:56 AM] 5298_
Most countries have Latin slogans, Latin is the official language of the Vatican, all the planets in the solar system are names in Latin, our school literally has Latin on its uniform and on the walls and on the slideshows


[03/08/2023 6:59 AM] 5298_
If that constitutes dead then Welsh is dead, Scots is dead, Irish is dead


[03/08/2023 4:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
welsh scottish and irish are considered pretty much dead


[03/08/2023 4:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dead isn't constituted by if it's a slogan that nobody pays attention to, it's more about if a lot of people read and write in it


[03/08/2023 4:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes people still speak Irish, Welsh, Scottish, but how many people actually usethem day-to-day, outside of school and are fluent?

[03/08/2023 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was shitting my pants but kept playing


[03/08/2023 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i kinda remember my first times playing and i wondered what was behind the help door


[03/08/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
It's my favourite game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II: Remaster (2020)


[03/08/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that was in like 2013


[03/08/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh the remaster


[03/08/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
I played the remaster remaster not too long ago and it was amazing


[03/08/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
It was completely different to the last remaster


[03/08/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I honestly hope when you die its just a fucking time loop, but you are still able to make different choices


[03/08/2023 10:30 PM] 5298_
It was just the same characters but a completely different story


[03/08/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like outer wilds


[03/08/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but you dont retain knowledge


[03/08/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
although the school part would be a bit retarded


[03/08/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
either that


[03/08/2023 10:31 PM] 5298_
I wish I could have known how awful secondary school is when I was in Junior school


[03/08/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the teachers made you know it was awful just in the wrong ways


[03/08/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
either youre in a timeloop when you die but you get to make different choices or you get reincarnated as another being


[03/08/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or you get to travel around the universe and shit


[03/08/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and watch it change


[03/08/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like in replay mode


[03/08/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
I made a theory about life in junior school


[03/08/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
share


[03/08/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
I called it the Many Frames Theory, it's that your whole life is set out in frames and your consciousness travels through these frames and witness your life. And you know when you dream about something that happens in the future and it actually happens, that's because your consciousness saw that frame before you lived it, same with Deja Vu


[03/08/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[03/08/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theres more to it than people think


[03/08/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not as straightforward as when you die theres nothing


[03/08/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe there is nothing to your perspective but consciousness is strange


[03/08/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont know how to explain it


[03/08/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You see shit that happens in the future down the very finest of detials


[03/08/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
details


[03/08/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in dreams


[03/08/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You know when something bad is coming months in advance


[03/08/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its so trange


[03/08/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
strange


[03/08/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
april 2023


[03/08/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my prediction for something very bad happening, whether that only affects me and my family or it affects the world


[03/08/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theres more than that i just cba writing it


[03/08/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but its strange


[03/08/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
people think science can explain it but i dont think it can


[03/08/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Those out of body experiences people have, they say its just a dream


[03/08/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
Once it's explained it will become a part of science


[03/08/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly but until then its not


[03/08/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
doctors hide words in cupboards that nobody knows about but people who have them question the doctors on what these words are


[03/08/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There has to be something to it


[03/08/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If the universe is conscious theory is correct, since you're part of it, then you always have been conscious and always will be in a way


[03/08/2023 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A living being is the universe experiencing itself


[03/08/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its wild


[03/08/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_
I think therefore I am


[03/08/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
The universe is so does it think


[03/08/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[03/08/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's not you thinking, it's the Universe


[03/08/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
We are universe


[03/08/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[03/08/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's what I mean


[03/08/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If the Universe is thinking, then even upon death we are thinking


[03/08/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Just as the Universe is


[03/08/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because we are it


[03/08/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and any aliens are it


[03/08/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
Therefore we are, and we think so the universe must think too


[03/08/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We all draw boundaries in terms of race and shit but there are no real boundaries because we are all the same thing


[03/08/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The universe is just 1 giant organism


[03/08/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or 1 giant brain at least


[03/08/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
Isn't it funny that the majority of humans are minorities


[03/08/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
True


[03/08/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
There are hundreds of characteristics in humans and only a few are classed as being in the majority


[03/08/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Everything is connected


[03/08/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We just need to find the things that connect them


[03/08/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
Cishet, white, western, neurotypical man. Everyone else is a minority


[03/08/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cishet


[03/08/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/08/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
Why?


[03/08/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IT DOESNT SOUND LIKE A WORD FOR SEXUALITY


[03/08/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
IT SOUNDS LIKE A WORD FOR A NUT


[03/08/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
CISHET NUT


[03/08/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LIKE CASHEW NUT OR HOWEVER YOU SPELL IT


[03/08/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
Cishet is just an abbreviation for Cisgender-hetrosexual


[03/08/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I KNOW


[03/08/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
BUT IT DOESNT SOUND LIKE IT SHOULD BE FOR THAT


[03/08/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
AND I HATE THAT WORD


[03/08/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/08/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ERADICATE IT


[03/08/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
BILLIONS (OF WORDS LIKE THAT) MUST DIE


[03/08/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LATINX IS A GODAWFUL WORD TOO


[03/08/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
DESTROY THAT WORD


[03/08/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WHITE 14 YEAR OLD TWITTER GIRLS MADE UP THAT WORD AS A SOLUTION FOR A PROBLEM THAT NEVER EXISTED


[03/08/2023 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
AND LATINO PEOPLE DONT EVEN LIKE IT


[03/08/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
Isn't it mental that 32.5% of all people live in two countries


[03/08/2023 10:51 PM] 5298_
2.6 billion people live in China and India alone


[03/08/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
BILLIONS MUST DIE

BILLIONS MUST CRY


[03/08/2023 10:53 PM] 5298_
We should get every evil person and put them on Australia and nuke it


[03/08/2023 10:53 PM] 5298_
We don't need the evil people or Australia


[03/08/2023 10:54 PM] 5298_
Every pedophile, every fascist ( so all of Italy and then some ) every bigot and nuke them all


[03/08/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I had high honor and i was a good boy


[03/09/2023 8:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then got good ending and did both endings


[03/09/2023 8:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Either a false-flag operation or a Russian/Russian backed violent act in NATO/NATO allied territory

When my language is finished i want to one day in the school out of the blue start using it and never speak english again to a teacher just to confuse the fuck out of them


[03/09/2023 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and they cant really translate it because the language never existed before


[03/09/2023 9:17 PM] 5298_
Maybe some words that sway to one language might be translatable but they'll make no fucking sense


[03/09/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I want to do it especially to mrs ralph cause she gets on my nerves

Do you think the reason the south has more counties than the north is so they have more influence in elections


[03/09/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I never even thought about that


[03/09/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
probably


[03/09/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
all the counties in the north are fucking huge unless its a city


[03/09/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
Cumbria is the size of like 4 southern counties


[03/09/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its the second largest county


[03/09/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyre splitting it up tho so the cumbrian region might have more influence in elections

and im not sure i agree with it but ill put it out here


[03/09/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How come being racist is seen as disgusting in western culture, but in nations where these protected people are from, they are highly racist to white people


[03/09/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its very stupid


[03/09/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i know it is


[03/09/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i find it sort of interesting


[03/09/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like in Japan, most nightclubs don't allow white people to enter because they aren't Japanese


[03/09/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but if you're racist to a Japanese person here it's considered disgusting


[03/09/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
The west has always had a disgusting problem with racism, genocide, slavery and such but most non-white cultures have only had negative experiences with white people. It's much less except for Asian people to be racist to black people because they've never had a problem with them before but it a race comes to your land, steals it, sends your child to a work camp, sends you into slavery and the rapes your wife you're probably going to see that race in a less positive light. In the modern age all racism should be calming down because now most of its systemic so any rational person would have no reason to hate another race


[03/09/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But what if I say I've only had negative experiences with black people, or my community has, then does that give me an excuse?


[03/09/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
Japan is just a very xenophobic culture historically anyways


[03/09/2023 11:02 PM] 5298_
Today, no it doesn't and it doesn't for non-white people too but if your community had the same experience with black people that black people did with white people then at the time it would be understandable. It's like how ancient cultures demonized certain animals because they've only known them as a detriment but in the modern age we're wiser. We can understand that we can condemn the actions of the past but that it shouldn't demonize the whole race


[03/09/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The thing is though, because these groups of people are protected in western culture, they're free to be as racist as they want to white people and I think that's fucking stupid. Speaking out against any race is racist and a hate crime, even if they hold a majority of power. All groups should be protected not just minorities. That's the only way to combat racism.


[03/09/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that goes for absolutely every group of people


[03/09/2023 11:03 PM] 5298_
Technically white people are protected but no one enforces it


[03/09/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[03/09/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just like how women who say kill all men arent really condemned, but men who say kill all women are


[03/09/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
everyone should be equal


[03/09/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
double standards are stupid


[03/09/2023 11:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it's not what the group of people someone belongs to, but what they're thinking


[03/09/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if a black man is talking shit about white people that's racist, if a white man is talking shit about black people then thats just as racist and should be enforced


[03/09/2023 11:05 PM] 5298_
It's so weird how in apparently the "most progressive time in history" we're completely okay to promote genocide


[03/09/2023 11:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[03/09/2023 11:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In fact we're so progressive that we're now banning white people from taking courses in the UK on the basis of skin tone


[03/09/2023 11:06 PM] 5298_
What


[03/09/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm not sure if that's true, but I swear I saw an article about it


[03/09/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and in some places in the US, they're stopping white people from signing up to an emergency service because they want to "combat" racism


[03/09/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We're fighting racism with racism


[03/09/2023 11:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/09/2023 11:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

True fact: I have never ejaculated ever because sperm isn't real, the shadow government made it up to hide the stalk operation


[03/09/2023 11:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I have ejaculated 9340 times and counting üáµüá±


[03/09/2023 11:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Every day I ejaculate 90 times, the number is rapidly increasing


[03/09/2023 11:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am the world champion of sperm release


[03/09/2023 11:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/10/2023 7:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant even talk to people normally


[03/10/2023 7:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
everyone hates me and doesnt want to be near me i swear


[03/10/2023 7:46 PM] 5298_
Well, I don't hate you


[03/10/2023 7:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I figured that


[03/10/2023 7:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it feels like everyone else does


[03/10/2023 7:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope one day im a normal fucking person and not just a fucking annoying little cunt that everyone despises


[03/10/2023 7:48 PM] 5298_
I think it's because they don't know you well enough


[03/10/2023 7:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes and also just cause im annoying and dont know how to speak to people


[03/10/2023 7:48 PM] 5298_
The way you act in class and when we talk is completely different, in class you can be annoying but I know you and know you can't really help it and know you as a person is much more than that


[03/10/2023 7:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats the fucking thing


[03/10/2023 7:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
everyone really only sees me in class


[03/10/2023 7:50 PM] 5298_
Everything is Television


[03/10/2023 7:52 PM] 5298_
It's a profound video I saw that says that we will never truly know anyone because we are all performing all the time, no one _knows_ you, not truly. The video takes this in a more nihilistic sense but I see it as people's opinions of you don't matter because they aren't opinions of _you_


[03/10/2023 7:54 PM] 5298_
Most people don't like me, most of them don't even know my name so why should I care


[03/10/2023 7:55 PM] 5298_
I think you should consider that the people that don't like you don't know you and I feel I have a decent understanding of who you are and I like you


[03/10/2023 7:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think im just fucking losing my mind


[03/10/2023 7:58 PM] 5298_

[03/10/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i wonder what id be like


[03/10/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
I thought you meant like have a crowd of people throw rocks at you


[03/10/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
no


[03/10/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
I'm curious but also terrified


[03/10/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/10/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was with someone and we were in this bunker then they started smoking weed and i breathed in too much smoke so when i got home i was slightly high


[03/10/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it wasnt really much different i was just happier, dizzy and my reflexes were off


[03/10/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i tried to play battlefield and couldnt kill anyone because by the time i realised they were there i was dead lmao


[03/10/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was rather strange


[03/10/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
I know that cannabis isn't really that dangerous but I'm still scared of getting addicted


[03/10/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[03/10/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
I don't want to get addicted to anything


[03/10/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it depends on how you take it


[03/10/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im sure if you just fucking eat it it thats not dangerous but smoking it is


[03/10/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
I don't think I would ever smoke anything because of my asthma


[03/10/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i forgot you had asthma


[03/10/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I never want to touch a cig tho


[03/10/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Those things are fucking minging


[03/10/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I used to vape a bit but stopped before I got addicted because obviously I dont want to


[03/10/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And also because it would probably kill me


[03/10/2023 10:27 PM] 5298_
Yeah, I hate fags


[03/10/2023 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/10/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe i will drink at family gatherings and shit


[03/10/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i dont want to be a loney cunt who drinks by themself


[03/10/2023 10:30 PM] 5298_
I would never drink underage because that can cause damage


[03/10/2023 10:30 PM] 5298_
If I do ever drink the first time would be like my father and I agreed, in Dublin on my 18th and he'd buy me a pint of Guinness

[03/10/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
Not that


[03/10/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when tf did you faint


[03/10/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
Which time?


[03/10/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
When I was 6, 11 and again when I was 11


[03/10/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
And nearly again on Wednesday


[03/10/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What tf does fainting feel like


[03/10/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just unconscious all of a sudden


[03/10/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
Weird


[03/10/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
DESCRIBE


[03/10/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
I don't faint normally though


[03/10/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i MUST know


[03/10/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
I see things which isn't normal


[03/10/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Is this before fainting or something


[03/10/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
The first time I fainted I went very light headed and my head felt like static then I just collapsed and went unconscious, whilst unconscious I saw Danielle and I in a field with trees that stretched unnaturally high and Danielle didn't look like 6 year old Danielle she looked exactly how she did when she was 12 and I was holding her hand I spun her around so I was the axis and she flew off the ground from the momentum, we were going insanely fast and Danielle's whole body was stretching and she was laughing that just as I let go I came to


[03/10/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Bro died üíÄ üî•


[03/10/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
Maybe


[03/10/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
It's 100% not natural


[03/10/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
I've never found a case of someone seeing things whilst fainting so to my knowledge I'm the only person and I literally saw the future


[03/10/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I searched it up and nothing came up to do with hallucinations while fainting


[03/10/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you mightve actually died and then went to a new timeline lmfao wtf


[03/10/2023 11:57 PM] 5298_
I always come to right before disaster


[03/10/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the only time you really hallucinate is when your brain loses oxygen, so you mustve stopped breathing


[03/10/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel like that light headed and static feeling a lot but never collapse or out


[03/10/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its weird and i hate it


[03/10/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
This thing always happens to me though where I think about something and I sort of faint but not really


[03/10/2023 11:58 PM] 5298_
I've been told that my whole body goes limp and my eyes roll to the back of my head


[03/10/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats what happens to me but I dont think its fainting


[03/10/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because im still conscious


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but its also kind of like deep sleep for a split second


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i get it all over


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like when im walking in the street and shit


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i get it in school sometimes, its rare


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i kept getting it the other night


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel light headed and dizzy


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] 5298_
I've died a lot


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then suddenly it feels like my soul gets pulled out of my body and pushed back in


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its strange


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not like fainting though


[03/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
as far as im aware my body doesnt really go limp


[03/11/2023 12:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i just stand there while i feel like im out of my own body


[03/11/2023 12:00 AM] 5298_
I have a lot of times where I'm talking to people and awake but I do not remember it, I was not conscious


[03/11/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That happens too


[03/11/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But im not talking or i am


[03/11/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/11/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/11/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/11/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
istg


[03/11/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was at will hunts caravan once and i have no recollection of this


[03/11/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but he made some food and he thought i was still awak


[03/11/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
awak


[03/11/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
awake


[03/11/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so he walked in and told me that he had food


[03/11/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i jolted up, looked around maybe said something and then went back to sleep


[03/11/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i have no fucking recollection of it


[03/11/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and when my mam wakes me up in the morning, sometimes i dont wake up because im still dreaming


[03/11/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but she says that I was awake or some shit


[03/11/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and when im falling back to sleep after being woken up sometimes it feels like the world is getting further and further away and it goes all echoey and shit then i pass out


[03/11/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when im going to sleep i start dreaming before i go unconscious


[03/11/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not lucid dreaming


[03/11/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its like a dream but contained in my head


[03/11/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its when im drifting off, all my thoughts start becoming distorted then i start hallucinating


[03/11/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sometimes i hear people talking who arent there


[03/11/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when im in that state, and im not dreaming


[03/11/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
one time i shit my pants and i thought i was becoming schizophrenic because i heard a woman scream but it was in my head and i could tell because it sounded clear and then some indian guy say something


[03/11/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
falling asleep is always a weird experience for me


[03/11/2023 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im gonna go now anyway


[03/11/2023 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im fucking gonna die of dehydration tiredness and hunger


[03/11/2023 12:08 AM] 5298_
I've been trying to find little differences between what my friend remembers and what I remember to see if I died


[03/11/2023 12:43 PM] 5298_
I just woke up


[03/11/2023 12:57 PM] 5298_

[03/11/2023 2:17 PM] 5298_
It seems alright I just don't want other people coming and killing me or robbing me every 5 minutes


[03/11/2023 2:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It is fucking shit


[03/11/2023 2:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/11/2023 2:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

i keep seeing them on my youtube recommended


[03/11/2023 7:26 PM] 5298_
I didn't realise that was the r word


[03/11/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they should reforest all of the lake district including the mountains


[03/11/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
imagine how beautiful it would be


[03/11/2023 7:28 PM] 5298_
Yes


[03/11/2023 7:28 PM] 5298_
That would be amazing


[03/11/2023 7:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You look across the channel at blackcombe and instead of seeing a dead rock you see a mountain covered in luscious green forests

[03/11/2023 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
THE VIEW IS FUCKING AWESOME


[03/11/2023 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I THOUGHT THAT WAS SCOTLAND OR SOMETHING


[03/11/2023 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
NOW IMAGINE THAT WITH A FOREST COVERING ALL OF IT


[03/11/2023 7:35 PM] 5298_
The fields with a thick forest would be amazing, maybe crawling up the foot of the mountain but further up should be tree-free so the view is easiest to see the view from up there


[03/11/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's what I imagine

[03/11/2023 7:44 PM] 5298_
I like art that shows production and interaction


[03/11/2023 7:45 PM] 5298_
Painting where you can see the strokes, music where you hear the press of the key or stum of the sting. Art not product

Do you ever forget that your body is actually yours, I constantly forget that my body is just as much as I as my thoughts


[03/11/2023 7:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm not sure


[03/11/2023 8:16 PM] 5298_
Danielle is watching Clifford the Big Red Dog because she's 7 but there's a freedom day and they're supposedly flying a bunch of different flags from all over the world, literally every flag is from Europe except from South Africa


[03/11/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just thought


[03/11/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what if neanderthals and denisovans never died out


[03/11/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
imagine what their history and culture would be like


[03/11/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
imagine what languages they would speak, the art they would produce


[03/11/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
Could Neanderthals and Denisovans talk?


[03/11/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
I thought that's how we killed them all


[03/11/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It is theorised that neanderthals spoke like humans


[03/11/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
Oh wait yeah


[03/11/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And if denisovans couldnt, they eventually would


[03/11/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
I'm retarded


[03/11/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just like humans did


[03/11/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they couldnt speak but then they did


[03/11/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to make an east germanic language


[03/11/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
east germanic languages went extinct


[03/11/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
Do you think there would have been more racism or less?


[03/11/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
more


[03/11/2023 10:27 PM] 5298_
I think less


[03/11/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would be specism at that point


[03/11/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
speciesism


[03/11/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not specism


[03/11/2023 10:27 PM] 5298_
I think if your civilization has been exposed to these other humans for centuries you're less likely to commit genocide or slavery when you find a different race


[03/11/2023 10:28 PM] 5298_
If Columbus lived just down the road from a Neanderthal he probably wouldn't have been so freaked out by the Indians as to fucking kill them all


[03/11/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
Maybe the Neanderthals would have owned us


[03/11/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
They were stronger and smarter


[03/11/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
Or killed us

Birth certificate, passport, bank statements


[03/11/2023 10:41 PM] 5298_
Burn all of it


[03/11/2023 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[03/11/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_
I want to have the power that I can say anything about myself and no one can prove me wrong


[03/11/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What


[03/11/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How does burning all your important shit make a point


[03/11/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_
It doesn't


[03/11/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
But I could say anything and no can prove me otherwise, I could say I was born on 4/6/07 and there is no evidence to go against that


[03/11/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
Legally I wouldn't exist


[03/11/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's not a good thing

You can't leave the country, you can't buy certain items

[03/11/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
I assault them back, who would they be looking for? I'm not real, I could get a fake ID and no can prove it wrong


[03/11/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And what if they beat the absolute living daylights out of you


[03/11/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_

Fair enough


[03/11/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but you shouldnt burn all your fucking ids and shit in case you want to not live like that


[03/11/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
I would rather starve in the woods than serve a government who doesn't know who I am

I was having the worst panic attack of my life, I was shaking and panting and Mrs. Southwell just said "is it a bit too loud for you?" That's not why I got that fucking card I fucking hate that they all assume that's my only fucking problem I got that card because I had sensory overload not because it was too loud


[03/11/2023 11:09 PM] 5298_
I fucking hate the hub so much


[03/11/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/11/2023 11:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
FUCK THE SCHOOL


[03/11/2023 11:12 PM] 5298_
They need to tell people to shut the fuck up or never come in again, I've been bullied in the hub - the place in school that helps people that get bullied - and they did fucking nothing and I know for a fact someone saw it because after the fact a TA came up to me and told me to ignore them but the didn't even try to intervene WHEN SHE FUCKING WATCHED IT HAPPEN, I WAS BEING BULLIED AND SHE JUST FUCKING WATCHED. NOT TO MENTION WHEN MRS. WOOD JUST WATCHED A STUDENT GETTING FUCKING KNOCKED OUT AND DID NOTHING UNTIL HE HAD ALREADY HIS THE FUCKING FLOOR

It's just constant bullying all the fucking time


[03/11/2023 11:20 PM] 5298_
I don't think teachers or my parents actually care how much it's affected me. I genuinely feel sick at the thought of leaving my house now, I've wanted to cut my fucking face off because I hate it that much, I don't trust anyone. When anyone tries to talk to me I always think they're doing it to make fun of me, I ignore everyone and avoid everyone

I've just seen an anti-car video and everyone in the comments was saying that problems caused by cars wouldn't be fixed anymore like it's a big gotcha moment, "I'm not walking 5 miles to the nearest convenience store", the shop wouldn't be 5 miles away without cars you fucking retard

My eyes work perfectly fine yet I still can't see. This isn't a metaphor. Maybe melodrama. Lucid, translucent light shapes stain my peripheral and sometimes the world is out of focus. It's like diluted schizophrenia. Maybe that's all I am, a diluted schizophrenic.

I saw someone say Trans Genocide isn't a real thing. Do they know what genocide is? A way genocide can be carried out is by making children from the group you want to exterminate apart of another.

AS DOWN THE GLEN ONE EASTER MORN


[03/19/2023 6:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the universe's expansion cant accelerate forever otherwise it would eventually be infinitely large


[03/19/2023 6:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so it must eventually slow down


[03/19/2023 6:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
even if that means that it doesnt come crashing back in on itself


[03/19/2023 6:34 PM] 5298_
Could it not be possible for the universe to be accelerating at an infinite speed into an infinite space?


[03/19/2023 6:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i doubt it


[03/19/2023 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if its not already infinite it probably doesnt have another chance at being infinite


[03/19/2023 6:35 PM] 5298_
But I guess then it would have to stop accelerating because it can't go past infinite


[03/19/2023 6:35 PM] 5298_
There's an infinite amount of nothing that the finite amount of thing can go into at an infinite speed


[03/19/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in order for it to be expanding it has to be finite so it would either eventually become infinite, but also would be expanding at an infinite speed which doesnt seem possible or it will eventually slow down


[03/19/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if it reaches an infinite size and theres still dark energy it would fucking destroy all of the multiverse (great theory)


[03/19/2023 6:38 PM] 5298_
The universe can go at an infinite speed


[03/19/2023 6:38 PM] 5298_
Matter can't exceed the speed of light


[03/19/2023 6:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes


[03/19/2023 6:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but dark energy drives its expansion and causes it to accelerate


[03/19/2023 6:39 PM] 5298_
What is the reaction to the universe?


[03/19/2023 6:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so if it reaches infinite size then it would have to have infinite speed, because its probably a great assumption to make that dark energy wouldnt just vanish


[03/19/2023 6:39 PM] 5298_
Well, the big bang

[03/19/2023 6:49 PM] 5298_
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The action of the big bang, what was the reaction?


[03/19/2023 6:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dark energy


[03/19/2023 6:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and stuff

[03/19/2023 8:55 PM] 5298_
Adults who say they don't know how to be an adult piss me off so much 
1. 'Adult' is a class of age, it just means someone over the age of 18 and sometimes people's between the ages of 18-66 or whatever the age is to be a pensioner in your country
2. The parameters of what an adult is are defined by how an adult acts, your generation sets the parameters of how your generation acts. There isn't a set 'Adult mode' it's been changing for all of human history. In the hunger-gather era to be an adult meant to go kill or forage and look after the children, because that's what they did but today no one except fringe uncontacted tribes like the one on North Sentinel Island do that so that isn't considered being an adult anymore because WE MOVE ON. Just be over 18, not be a pensioner and not be dead and you're being an adult


[03/19/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I spend a lot of time looking at screens and yet im 99% sure i dont need glasses

I can unfocus my eyes at will and the first time I did it I didn't know how to go back so I thought I needed them and then I figured it out but by that point I had been prescribed them


[03/19/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[03/19/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/19/2023 10:51 PM] 5298_
Too hot, I nearly got mugged, there were police patrols all the time and I wasn't allowed to take my mask off in 35¬∞C weather


[03/19/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i went in february 2020 right before covid took off


[03/19/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was still 30 degrees


[03/19/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i went to lloret de mar in 2019 and it was fucking funny


[03/19/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i remember me my dad and my brother went for a walk to explore the area and we came across this wooded area


[03/19/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so we started walking around


[03/19/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then all of a sudden this massive fucking rottweiler appears and stares at us


[03/19/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so my dad shouted "THERES A MASSIVE ROTTWEILER FUCKING RUN"


[03/19/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and he ran off


[03/19/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but me and my brother stayed and this little old lady was just walking her dog through the woods


[03/19/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we thought we were on private land


[03/19/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was fucking funny man


[03/19/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i nearly drowned because the waves were literally 20ft tall


[03/19/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
on one day


[03/19/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i did not nearly drown because of the 20ft waves that day


[03/19/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but on another day the waves were powerful and i got dragged under by one and got stuck


[03/19/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i thought i was gonna die


[03/19/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
drinking the fucking mediterranean


[03/19/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was hrorible


[03/19/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the salty water mummified my throat


[03/19/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
I nearly drowned at a beach once, the waves were like 10-15 ft and I thought it would be a great idea to run at one, it threw me in the air, flipped me upside down and crashed me around underwater by some rocks. I fully thought I was dead


[03/19/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im looking around google maps and the thought of it being another country where people live and shit made me nearly pass out idk why


[03/19/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
It is a weird thought


[03/19/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/19/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/19/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it had like shops and shit in it


[03/19/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/19/2023 11:04 PM] 5298_

[03/19/2023 11:06 PM] 5298_
I was walking through the market and a salesman snook up behind me and tried to get into my behind pocket, either that or he was trying to rape me

I walked like a mile to get there without any water and I ran the mile back to the bar and ordered a pint of iced coke and downed it in 10 seconds


[03/19/2023 11:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/19/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

We were in Rhyl and we went up to Snowdonia in Penhryn so my dad and stepmum could do the world's fastest zipline and we were going to hike Snowdonia after but we didn't

the room was so cozy, i had my bed my xbox my pc and it was nice and sunny


[03/19/2023 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i am very prone to nostalgia


[03/19/2023 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its a bad thing, but sometimes helps me feel optimistic about the future


[03/19/2023 11:28 PM] 5298_
The only thing I wish I could relieve was junior school


[03/19/2023 11:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
junior school was goated


[03/19/2023 11:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/19/2023 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theres this dead creepy hut that were gonna go to


[03/19/2023 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/19/2023 11:31 PM] 5298_
I had a friend throughout all of junior school. Mo, he was called and he was great. We knew each other so well we could look at each other and know exactly what we were thinking. He's the one that I came up with the Many Frames Theory with


[03/19/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont think this year will be close to as good as last year


[03/19/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what was the many frames theory again


[03/19/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if you ever explained it


[03/19/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think i remember a tiny bit of it


[03/19/2023 11:32 PM] 5298_
Your entire life is set out in frames and your consciousness moves through it. It's a bit more complicated than that but that's the basis


[03/19/2023 11:32 PM] 5298_
I think I'll have a much better summer this year than last


[03/19/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
I fucking hated last summer


[03/19/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope it will be but i doubt it


[03/19/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my granddad probably doesnt have long left and i doubt hell make it to summer


[03/19/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
hes been looking better recently but im not sure


[03/19/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he has lung cancer which is obviously pretty common


[03/19/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think its gone into a short remission, or thats what i heard a couple of weeks ago


[03/19/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not ready to lost another relative, but itll probably happen this year


[03/19/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/19/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
itll be extra difficult too since ive made so many memories with him


[03/19/2023 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but life will be life


[03/19/2023 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i fucking hope he makes it past summer at least i want to have a good summer again


[03/19/2023 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
summer is the best time of the year


[03/19/2023 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A good summer is always followed by a shit winter


[03/19/2023 11:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Hey its april next month


[03/19/2023 11:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that marks the start of the good times a bit


[03/19/2023 11:39 PM] 5298_
Last summer I had just fallen out with my friends so I had no friends and like 2 months before I had broken up with my girlfriend who I'd been with for nearly a year so I was completely alone. I was also severely struggling with my mental health and self image, I had no idea who I wanted to be, I was having a gender crisis and I was having trouble with body and facial dysmorphia. I would look in the mirror and actually gag at myself and constantly thought about cutting my face off. That's one of the very few times I considered killing myself, I was going to starve myself to death and I didn't eat for two days. But by the end of the summer I started to reconnect with old friends from junior school and I got a girlfriend, that's S who I've talked about and now I don't want to kill myself so that's a plus


[03/19/2023 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Polar opposite summers


[03/19/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2020 summer was good but i was turning schizophrenic and was going completely insane from not going outside


[03/19/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2021 was just pure dog shit


[03/19/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and so boring


[03/19/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2022 was the best summer ive probably ever had


[03/19/2023 11:41 PM] 5298_
I loved 2020


[03/19/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I did too


[03/19/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but like i said i was genuinely going insane


[03/19/2023 11:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i thought fucking Isis was going to kill me for some reason


[03/19/2023 11:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought there were people hiding in my walls and in my wardrobe who were going to kill me in my sleep


[03/19/2023 11:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i thought that there were evil entities in my house who were watching me


[03/19/2023 11:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mate it was a great year but i didnt like the psychosis part


[03/19/2023 11:43 PM] 5298_
COVID gave you schizophrenia


[03/19/2023 11:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ive had covid a couple of times


[03/19/2023 11:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i probably have it now but i just dont feel the effects of it


[03/19/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my body is probably very ill but i dont feel very ill


[03/19/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i keep coughing like mad coughing phlegm up and sneezing and having to clear my nose out


[03/19/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i feel fine


[03/19/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think that might be a bad thing


[03/19/2023 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

The dad really did have a struggle


[03/19/2023 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if i had something wrong with me i will do an arthur morgan i will mate


[03/19/2023 11:50 PM] 5298_
I've decided if I find out I have some illness that could kill me instead of getting medical aid I'm just going to go completely batshit insane


[03/19/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That is my choice too


[03/19/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont give a shit if god exists


[03/19/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ill just stay in purgatory for a bit


[03/19/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i will do a walter white because im going to die anyway


[03/19/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them


[03/19/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and arthur morgan is a bit before our time


[03/19/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
god seems like a cunt


[03/19/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he sounds like the soviet government


[03/19/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or something


[03/19/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or a fascist one i meant


[03/19/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
soviets were communist


[03/19/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
satan threatened his power so he created an eternal jail and sent him to it


[03/19/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
god has killed millions, satan has only killed a few


[03/19/2023 11:53 PM] 5298_
Ehhh


[03/19/2023 11:53 PM] 5298_
Debatable


[03/19/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if god exists then it seems unlikely hell would exist too


[03/19/2023 11:53 PM] 5298_
Technically every death is Satan's doing because he created death


[03/19/2023 11:54 PM] 5298_
Death wouldn't exist without the fall which Satan created


[03/19/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if god created everything, then he created satan


[03/19/2023 11:54 PM] 5298_
Fair


[03/19/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and if satan created death, then he must be on a similar level to god


[03/19/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in terms of power


[03/19/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the bibles sounds more like a novel to me


[03/19/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
bible


[03/19/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
He is omnipotent so he created Satan knowing he would be prideful and destroy man


[03/19/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what a fucking retard


[03/19/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
god is more retarded than me


[03/19/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i will fight god


[03/19/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
God created the fruit of knowledge of good and evil, Satan tricked Eve into eating it so Satan unleashed death but didn't create it. I used the wrong language


[03/19/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
god will meet me at aldi tomorrow and ill beat his ass

[03/20/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
I have no idea what mine is


[03/20/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the only reason i get so many behaviour points this year is because i dont go to detention


[03/20/2023 12:10 AM] 5298_
I don't go to class


[03/20/2023 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

God got bears to maul children to death because they called Elijah bald


[03/20/2023 12:20 AM] 5298_
42 children were mauled to death my bears commanded by God because they teased a profit


[03/20/2023 12:21 AM] 5298_
Literally all they said was "Go away bald head! Go away bald head" and God fucking mauled nearly four dozen children to death


[03/20/2023 12:30 AM] 5298_

[03/20/2023 8:45 PM] 5298_
I find them utterly fascinating


[03/20/2023 8:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Me too


[03/20/2023 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And the fact they were around in the 1500s blows my mind for some reason


[03/20/2023 8:52 PM] 5298_
Wasn't that the Aztecs


[03/20/2023 8:52 PM] 5298_
The Spanish made contact with the Aztecs


[03/20/2023 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh shit ye


[03/20/2023 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/20/2023 8:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nvm


[03/20/2023 8:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im retarded as shit when it comes to mayans and aztecs


[03/20/2023 8:54 PM] 5298_
They were very similar, the Aztecs followed similar beliefs, lived in the same area and made similar structures


[03/20/2023 8:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly


[03/20/2023 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i find tropical cultures very interesting, specifically the central-southern american ones such as aztecs and shit and the pacific islands


[03/20/2023 8:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/20/2023 8:56 PM] 5298_

hitler its a massive retard


[03/20/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he shouldnt have broken the molotov ribbentrop pact until the uk had surrendered


[03/20/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or had exited the war


[03/20/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and the japanese shouldnt have attacked pearl harbor


[03/20/2023 9:24 PM] 5298_
Do you reckon if you were a foreign general that you could successfully take out the UK in war


[03/20/2023 9:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
probably not


[03/20/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but had the germans just not invaded the soviets then the tide of war couldve been much further in their favour


[03/20/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
hitler was too desperate


[03/20/2023 9:26 PM] 5298_
The invasion of the USSR was the stupidest thing Hitler could have ever done


[03/20/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly


[03/20/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
Wasn't he a huge fan of Napoleon?


[03/20/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[03/20/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ironic


[03/20/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_
He loved Napoleon and did the exact thing that cost him his Empire


[03/20/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i believe that if he had taken the uk out of the war first, he couldve absolutely have taken the soviets out after


[03/20/2023 9:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but just like napoleon he made a very silly mistake


[03/20/2023 9:29 PM] 5298_
Taking out Britain after France would have been his best chance although it might have made America join faster


[03/20/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He didnt want to completely fuck the uk over because he saw us as aryans and destroying aryans goes against his whole idea


[03/20/2023 9:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the americans wouldnt have joined unless something happened to them directly


[03/20/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

the cold war never ended


[03/20/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
A land invasion would have been his best choice to uphold his values but if you aren't a spastic with retarded views then you 100% do not do a land invasion of Britain

exactly

If I was Hitler then I would have made the Japanese do the blockade on Britain


[03/20/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Actually i just read up a bit and it seems if the germans didnt do barbarossa then the soviets probably would not too long after the germans did in our universe


[03/20/2023 9:35 PM] 5298_
Japan already was going to fuck over America so having America join the war in only the Pacific theatre would have been better for Hitler, then he could starve out Britain and maybe launch a success invasion of the USSR, and if he was successful then he could get to the Pacific theatre, defeat the Americans and fuck over the Japanese and own the world


[03/20/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_

Rreth flamurit t√´ p√´rbashkuar
Me nj√´ d√´shir‚Äô e nj√´ q√´llim,
T√´ gjith‚Äô atij duke u betuar
T√´ lidhim bes√´n p√´r shp√´tim.
Prej lufte ve√ß ai largohet
Q√´ √´sht√´ lindur tradh√´tor,
Kush √´sht√´ burr√´ nuk friksohet,
Por vdes, por vdes si nj√´ d√´shmor!

N√´ dor√´ arm√´t do t‚Äôi mbajm√´,
T√´ mbrojm√´ atdheun n√´ √ßdo k√´nd,
T√´ drejtat tona ne s‚Äôi ndajm√´;
K√´tu armiqt√´ s‚Äôkan√´ v√´nd!
Se Zoti vet√´ e tha me goj√´
Q√´ kombe shuhen p√´rmbi dhe,
Po Shqip√´ria do t√´ rroj√´;
P√´r t√´, p√´r t√´ luftojm√´ ne!

O Flamur, flamur, shenj‚Äô e shenjt√´
tek ti betohemi k√´tu
p√´r Shqip√´rin√´, atdheun e shtrenjt√´,
p√´r nder‚Äô edhe lavdimn e tu.
Trim burr√´ quhet dhe nderohet
atdheut kush iu b√´ therror.
P√´rjet√´ ai do t√´ kujtohet
mbi dhe, n√´n dhe si nj√´ shenjtor!

That's Isabel's YouTube, she was watching it in computing


[03/21/2023 6:23 PM] 5298_
She looked like a bloated whale carcass back then too


[03/21/2023 6:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/21/2023 6:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/21/2023 6:25 PM] 5298_
We should send her to Alaska so they can whale her

lines are completely fucked from the french side


[03/21/2023 6:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
germans can advance rapidly because of that


[03/21/2023 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they push their defences back to the siene


[03/21/2023 6:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but they doubt it can hold because of the advancing british army on the other side

I got jumpscared by the n word today


[03/21/2023 9:00 PM] 5298_
I was reading a book in form and 109 pages in there wasn't a single offensive thing in the book, not even a swear word even though it's set in a penitentiary, and then suddenly it called a black man the n word

[03/21/2023 9:02 PM] 5298_
Remember when everyone thought the Poseidon torpedo was going to kill us all and then nothing happened


[03/21/2023 9:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think I was the only one with common sense


[03/21/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yeah but we shouldnt be supplying ukraine with fucking uranium shells anyway


[03/21/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Nuclear Armageddon


[03/21/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
eventually we'll think russia is showing a weakspot and we'll start selling nukes to ukraine


[03/21/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its probably only a matter of time at this rate


[03/21/2023 9:04 PM] 5298_
WORLD WAR THREE


[03/21/2023 9:04 PM] 5298_
Remember in 2020 when we all thought world war three was going to happen


[03/21/2023 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I didnt think world war 3 would happen


[03/21/2023 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe i did a bit but a world war 3 with iran wouldnt be a world war 3


[03/21/2023 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
itd be a gulf war part 2


[03/21/2023 9:07 PM] 5298_
World war three will come out of the cold war


[03/21/2023 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
world war 3 is going to happen soon


[03/21/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe not this year but in the next 10 i predict


[03/21/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe they said that in the cold war tho


[03/21/2023 9:10 PM] 5298_

[03/21/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

not necessarily the aggressor


[03/21/2023 9:11 PM] 5298_
For one time it's Poland being the aggressor


[03/21/2023 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmao


[03/21/2023 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not been that way since the middle ages


[03/21/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
I think the reason Europe is so anti-Semitic is because the Jews saved the Polish from the black death and everyone hated Poland


[03/21/2023 9:15 PM] 5298_
I felt a lot more unmasked today in more ways than one


[03/21/2023 9:19 PM] 5298_

[03/22/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought you would have the day off


[03/22/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/22/2023 7:18 PM] 5298_

I can't look at a place in the world and see it for what it is I still see the borders

i do too but i also just see a blank satellite map

I lack the courage to stick to anything I want to do

[03/22/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel that way


[03/22/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I need to stop being so nervous all the time


[03/22/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its a result of lockdown


[03/22/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the insanity shit made me really nervous


[03/22/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was socially anxious beforehand but it made it so much worse


[03/22/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/22/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im just scared of disappointing


[03/22/2023 9:32 PM] 5298_
I feel much happier and energetic when I'm with friends but I don't have the courage to make any friends and I'm terrified of doing anything wrong


[03/22/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh


[03/22/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you ever want to talk but physically cant


[03/22/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i fucking hate that


[03/22/2023 9:33 PM] 5298_
I put myself on a pedestal, I know I'm smart and I know I can do well so when I don't I feel like a failure. I get so angry at myself if I get below 65% on a test, I feel like a complete failure because I know I can get so much higher


[03/22/2023 9:33 PM] 5298_
Yes, it's awful


[03/22/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate it


[03/22/2023 9:34 PM] 5298_
I've tried to explain it and people don't understand it so they think I'm just rude


[03/22/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am going to start going to the gym, i never really work out so thats probably one of the issues with my mental health atm


[03/22/2023 9:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the only way i could win a fight right now is if super autism mode activated


[03/22/2023 9:34 PM] 5298_
I would rather be brittle than go to the gym


[03/22/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel a bit like that but I know that working out can help a lot with mental health


[03/22/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im feeling happier recently but also at the same time worse its very strange


[03/22/2023 9:35 PM] 5298_
I feel like I'm regressing


[03/22/2023 9:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
regressing back into childhood would not be that bad


[03/22/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2013-2019 were good years


[03/22/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im still in childhood


[03/22/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
obviously


[03/22/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i mean further back


[03/22/2023 9:36 PM] 5298_
I'm regressing back to one of the worst times of my life


[03/22/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or adolescence


[03/22/2023 9:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
youll be stuck in a loop like that forever unless you try do something


[03/22/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
I could be so much happier if I didn't have school


[03/22/2023 9:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
me too


[03/22/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
I could actually do what I want


[03/22/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
Maybe things will get better in summer


[03/22/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
I'll have the time to help myself


[03/22/2023 9:37 PM] 5298_
I don't know what I want though


[03/22/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
I don't know what the problem is so I can't fix it


[03/22/2023 9:39 PM] 5298_
I think I want to make something I can be proud of. Something I can point to and say that I did this and this is good, if this is meaningful then I must be too


[03/22/2023 9:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if i go to the gym it is about being stronger and not a fucking skeleton but also its about feeling better mentally and probably happier


[03/22/2023 9:40 PM] 5298_
I want to be weak


[03/22/2023 9:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[03/22/2023 9:41 PM] 5298_
I'm a very violent person and I hate it, if I was strong then I would be terrified all the time of hurting someone


[03/22/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the funny thing is thomas purcell said hed be terrified of me if i started going to the gym because then id be retarded and strong


[03/22/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im weak now but im a tad stronger than i look so he thinks that i would be terrifying


[03/22/2023 9:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont think i would be

[03/22/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_
I like to think I'm a competent author and I think a book would be the thing I could point to and derive meaning from

A man feels the unrelenting urge to reach the summit of a far off mountain at the horizon. His journey takes him across the plains of which he lives and meets many a colourful character and many a beautiful scene. His journey is a turbulent one, he journeys plains, traverses caverns and eventually climbs the mountain. He grows weak as he climbs and it takes him many months. On his fortieth day, he can see his town on the same horizon he used to see the mountain and realizes how far he has come. He climbs still, almost at his long awaited peak. He arrives, half dead with the trials he's faced but ultimately feels it was worth it

[03/25/2023 12:01 PM] 5298_
I love that when you start to act like an outlaw again there's the wild west music but it's subtle and goes sombre, and when John put his old outfit on and rode out of the ranch it was this big burst of Wild West showing he was determined to do what Sadie asked of him


[03/25/2023 12:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

One of the river dancers was frilling her dress and moved it very far up and she wasn't wearing any pants


[03/25/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
hundreds of people got flashed then


[03/25/2023 10:53 PM] 5298_
Yes


[03/25/2023 10:54 PM] 5298_
It's kind of stupid to be a river dancer in such a short dress and not wear any pants


[03/25/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Aside from the flashing you would have loved the show


[03/25/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
Or maybe you would have liked the flashing I don't know, but it was a very funny show. I have some videos I'll send to you on Snapchat

I tried to make pancakes but i fucking didnt realise the stove was off so i kept making them wondering why no matter the amount of oil i put in the pancake mix it was floating


[03/26/2023 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I've just looked up why they burn crosses


[03/26/2023 9:04 PM] 5298_
It's from the Scottish


[03/26/2023 9:05 PM] 5298_
When Scottish clans would go to war they'd light a cross to mobilise the clansmen, that's why the KKK do it, to mobilise the Klan in their war against non-whites

It was funny today i was out with cole and lucus then we went on the multi and started shouting shit at the people walking in town from up there then there was this dead fat group of emo-chav hybrids by the exit so we started talking dead loudly about how fat they were and if they were gonna chase us then it would be like the boulder scene from indiana jones and they started staring at us but we were pissing ourselves laughing]

She came up to me and said "you're gay aren't you? You like cock" so I told her to "shut the fuck up you freak" then she said I like to ride your cock so I told her to kill herself right in front of Nikki


[03/27/2023 10:02 PM] 5298_
She never gets told off, you do


[03/27/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[03/27/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i feel like all the teachers hate me


[03/27/2023 10:02 PM] 5298_
She gets fucking praised


[03/27/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She gets praised cause shes a woman


[03/27/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate her


[03/27/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope she dies


[03/27/2023 10:03 PM] 5298_
She says she has:
Autism
ADHD
Tourettes
BPD
Depression
Anxiety


[03/27/2023 10:03 PM] 5298_
The likelihood of having just one of those is small but believable but all of them?


[03/27/2023 10:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik she learnt all that shit off tiktok i bet


[03/27/2023 10:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i wonder if she was normal before she discovered tiktok and heard of all of those


[03/27/2023 10:04 PM] 5298_
She didn't show any sign of tourettes last year or the year before or when she has strict teachers or assembly


[03/27/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe i should start faking loads of stuff


[03/27/2023 10:05 PM] 5298_
If she had tourettes that wouldn't be how it worked


[03/27/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate all the teachers apart from mr turner and mrs mills and they all hate me


[03/27/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I know they all hate me


[03/27/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate that fucking school


[03/27/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They do everything wrong


[03/27/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to burn it down


[03/27/2023 10:05 PM] 5298_
It was a bit rude how Mrs. Pharoe just called you a spastic in front of everyone


[03/27/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik


[03/27/2023 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then tried to say i was happy because i am a privileged man


[03/27/2023 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mrs pharoah is a good teacher but she thinks everyone who isnt a straight white man is a victim


[03/27/2023 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
shes got the victim mentality


[03/27/2023 10:06 PM] 5298_
Yeah, she has some victim complex


[03/27/2023 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
at the moment men are some of the least privileged people around


[03/27/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
Kind of


[03/27/2023 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They are tho


[03/27/2023 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
everything seems to be in favour of women


[03/27/2023 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
anyone who is a straight white man needs to be punished it seems


[03/27/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
It depends where you are


[03/27/2023 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In most countries nowadays it feels that way


[03/27/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
But definitely in the west it's like that


[03/27/2023 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yeah thats where i mean


[03/27/2023 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mrs pharoah needs to drop the victim mentality


[03/27/2023 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it pisses me off


[03/27/2023 10:09 PM] 5298_
I'm technically a minority but I don't feel that oppressed


[03/27/2023 10:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to do stuff but i overthink a lot


[03/27/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like i keep saying its slowly going away but it still happens all too often


[03/27/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
I keep telling myself that I'm fucked anyways so I might as well be fucked on my own terms


[03/27/2023 10:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i hate how they always try to make depression and anxiety and other things as a buzzword

I try to grasp at any control I can


[03/27/2023 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
to be honest i did tell some kids today that im gonna eat their dog so maybe im not so bad


[03/27/2023 10:12 PM] 5298_
I think that's why I stay up so late and skip lessons I don't like


[03/27/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
May you little jigga


[03/27/2023 10:13 PM] 5298_
It's mainly Music

I fucking hate music


[03/27/2023 10:13 PM] 5298_
And currently P.E.


[03/27/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
School is so fucked


[03/27/2023 10:13 PM] 5298_
I'm not going to P.E. until it goes back to normal


[03/27/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyve been giving people detentions for being late


[03/27/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
is that not fucked


[03/27/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ive got little siblings i dont think they realise tho


[03/27/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i cant get the bus cause its like 50 quid a month


[03/27/2023 10:14 PM] 5298_
It's pissed me off so much


[03/27/2023 10:14 PM] 5298_
I didn't get a choice


[03/27/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Neither


[03/27/2023 10:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The governments fucked i just want to go out and riot


[03/27/2023 10:16 PM] 5298_
I can't do football because I don't have the equipment and I can't do table tennis because the shark teeth ginger little retarded rapist freak is doing it and I will sooner die than be even tolerant of that fucking freak


[03/27/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just chose football because i had to choose and the rest were shit


[03/27/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont have the equipment either


[03/27/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just want to drop out


[03/27/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I fucking hate it


[03/27/2023 10:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate every little aspect


[03/27/2023 10:17 PM] 5298_
If I did P.E. with him I would have smashed his fucking head in, I'm not joking I would have fucking killed him


[03/27/2023 10:17 PM] 5298_
School makes me feel worthless


[03/27/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
gareth was calling layla and voice messaging her so me lucus and cole started saying very very racist things down the mic


[03/27/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They say i need special education but they dont fucking help me


[03/27/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they just expect me to ride out the storm


[03/27/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the hub doesnt do shit


[03/27/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i feel worthless when i go to that school i feel like im just a resource


[03/27/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or a way to make money


[03/27/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
a way to fill the pockets of the corporate greedy man mr croft


[03/27/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i hate it


[03/27/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
school feels more like auschwitz than a school


[03/27/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it needs to be changed to suit the students and not the pockets of the higher ups


[03/27/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
The hub is a sad excuse of a help program but it's my only choice if I don't want to fucking kill myself, test scores make me feel fucking worthless


[03/27/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
I think I've just been given a lot of pressure though


[03/27/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to stay off school but theyll fine my mum again


[03/27/2023 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
she doesnt keep me off when im ill out of fear


[03/27/2023 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i could be dying but i would have to go in because its mandatory


[03/27/2023 10:20 PM] 5298_
My dad treats me like the second coming of Einstein for some reason so if I'm not perfect I feel like I'm a failure. I'm even upset about my English score


[03/27/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im just a shell of what i couldve been now cause of lockdown


[03/27/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it fucked me up so bad in the head


[03/27/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I used to get really high test scores and that but no fuck that because we need some time off cause of an illness


[03/27/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont even care how bad it was


[03/27/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_
My mentality is "94% is good but it isn't not 95% and 95% is good but it isn't 96%" and dinand so forth


[03/27/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lockdown was fun but the fact i saw nobody for months made me go insane


[03/27/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats how i feel


[03/27/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i know i can do better but i cant unlock that potential because the school wont let me and i dont know how


[03/27/2023 10:22 PM] 5298_
If I'm not perfect then I'm not good enough


[03/27/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was predicted some of the highest gcse grades bernards wouldve seen mrs wood told me not sure how true it is but clearly it wont hold up if it was


[03/27/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i cant get help because my dads a knob and refuses to believe that there can be anything wrong with me in the head and its just a benefits scam


[03/27/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
despite the fact ive been like this my entire life


[03/27/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
That's why I love art, art is subjective so I _can_ be perfect because it's whatever I want it to be but I don't think I could ever get a career in it


[03/27/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
I want to get tested but I don't know what it would do


[03/27/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
I don't know what the point is


[03/27/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its not even that i want to be tested at this point


[03/27/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just want someone to listen


[03/27/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
All I want is an answer but I'm terrified I'll get tested and it turns out I'm neurotypical so I have nothing to point to as to my I'm like this other than I'm a freak


[03/27/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel like that


[03/27/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I've got no hope in life anymore but i still cling on to it


[03/27/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
I just want to know why I'm so violent. Above anything else that's all I want to know


[03/27/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe im just depressed because ive been like this for a long time but i feel some sort of paradoxical happiness and sadness at the same time


[03/27/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe paradoxical is the wrong word but its at least contradictory


[03/27/2023 10:27 PM] 5298_
My mother had to put locks on the French doors into the living room so that when I had an outburst she and Danielle could hide because I would just beat the shit out of them all the time, I'm pretty sure school was worried because Danielle used to go in with bruises


[03/27/2023 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I used to scrap my old brother all the time but i always won because i would get that much adrenaline or at least thats how it felt in my perspective


[03/27/2023 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont know why but he used to always attack me for no reason but id get that pissed off that id claw his face open and shit


[03/27/2023 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
one time i kept punching him that much it put a hole in his face


[03/27/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he was way stronger than me i dont have a fucking clue how i managed it


[03/27/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
I'm surprised I haven't concussed myself


[03/27/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
one time he was trying to scrap me then i tried to pour water over him because i couldnt be bothered but then he threw at my head and it smashed all over


[03/27/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was a pint glass too


[03/27/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
Now when I get angry, instead of hitting someone else I hit myself in the head


[03/27/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate school


[03/27/2023 10:30 PM] 5298_
Just a flurry of punches and slaps to my head


[03/27/2023 10:30 PM] 5298_
I had an outburst in the hub and they locked me in F1


[03/27/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i want to destroy it


[03/27/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they cant lock me up in prison for 6 hours a day and expect me to be happy


[03/27/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/27/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/27/2023 10:37 PM] 5298_
It would mean that politics is just a scale of extremism

[03/27/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_

[03/27/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
I want to be very antisocial


[03/27/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
Most people have made me want to never leave me house and kill myself so I might as well return the favour


[03/27/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
I want to go into the middle of nowhere and scream at the top of my lungs until they give out


[03/27/2023 10:52 PM] 5298_
I'm just going to accept that my life is going to be a disaster


[03/27/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel the same way


[03/27/2023 10:53 PM] 5298_

Until April 2023 Cumbria will be administered by Cumbria County Council and six district councils: Allerdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Copeland, Eden, and South Lakeland.

In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that, on 1 April 2023, the administrative county will be reorganised into two unitary authorities: one to be known as Cumberland, and the other as Westmorland and Furness. Cumbria County Council and the six districts are to be abolished and their functions transferred to the new authorities.[46] The two new unitary authorities will continue to constitute a ceremonial county named "Cumbria" for the purpose of lieutenancy and shrievalties, being presided over by a Lord Lieutenant of Cumbria and a High Sheriff of Cumbria.[47][48]

I have a philosophy that I believe is true but I know most people wouldn't like to agree with it


[03/27/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what would that be


[03/27/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
Everyone is selfish


[03/27/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Everyone is selfish


[03/27/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
There are no exceptions


[03/27/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I agree


[03/27/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
No saint, no sinner, no man, no woman, everyone is selfish

its always white people get offended on the behalf of others


[03/27/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i say its always white people because white people make up the majority of the western world


[03/27/2023 10:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
where we are fed the 'everyone who is not straight, white or a man is a victim'


[03/27/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
Even if you live a selfless life you're doing it because it makes _you_ feel happy to do so. Even Buddhists who are notoriously selfless are selfish because they do it to reach enlightenment for themselves


[03/27/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[03/27/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/27/2023 11:06 PM] 5298_

[03/28/2023 12:52 PM] 5298_
And why's that?


[03/28/2023 12:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because my mum had to go up north at 10 to 8 this morning and she either couldnt wake me up or just left us in bed


[03/28/2023 12:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In the morning if you dont wake me up properly i start responding and that but im fast asleep

It pisses me off to no end that when marginalised groups talk about their oppression they immediately attack the opposite community


[03/28/2023 6:35 PM] 5298_
Like, when women's rights to autonomy were in question it was immediately KILL ALL MEN! The solution to your oppression isn't genocide. Same with gay people, I just saw someone say that the reason straight people are homophobic is because they all have unhealthy relationships. That's so fucking retarded, not all straight people are abusive partners and not all gay people are healthy partners


[03/28/2023 6:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mrs pharoah defo supports the kill all men movement

Why?


[03/28/2023 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We strive for happiness but we favour bad over good


[03/28/2023 10:08 PM] 5298_
Maybe in practicality and morally but inwardly we favour good over bad


[03/28/2023 10:08 PM] 5298_
Bad morals for good ends, even if it is a selfish good


[03/28/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Morally but socially and everything else you favour bad

[03/28/2023 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My mum said I'm looking for the article now


[03/28/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They can't call him a victim of domestic abuse because he's a man it seems


[03/28/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's how fucked society is

[03/28/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The way they titled that is fucked


[03/28/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
The title seems to paint him as selfish but the article - at least to me - seems to portray why he did drugs. It doesn't have much reverence for him though. You would know how accurate it is better than I though


[03/28/2023 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's a death inquest so they have the right to make that article but they barely mention the domestic abuse and brush it off because she's a woman they barely talk about it


[03/28/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not to mention she's a fucking nonce


[03/28/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to kill her and I want to kill whoever made that article


[03/28/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They didn't mention what she did when she found him unconscious


[03/28/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She left him on the landing for 40 minutes and went through his phone


[03/28/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She left him to die but they don't mention that


[03/28/2023 10:23 PM] 5298_
Vile


[03/28/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She is fucking vile and so is the bbc


[03/28/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's why they couldn't resuscitate him


[03/28/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's why he's dead


[03/28/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She should be done for manslaughter at least


[03/28/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
Assisted suicide


[03/28/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
Maybe


[03/28/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
He killed himself with the drugs and she did nothing to help


[03/28/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
His actions led to him collapsing but her carelessness led to his death


[03/28/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
Some people don't deserve to live. That woman is one of them


[03/28/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
His death would've been completely preventable if she had taken action that's why it should be manslaughter


[03/28/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I honestly think nothings being said because she's a woman it always seems domestic issues and whatnot are downplayed when a man is the victim


[03/28/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe I'm wrong


[03/28/2023 10:31 PM] 5298_

[03/28/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why did they drop it


[03/28/2023 10:37 PM] 5298_

[03/28/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I will probably lose another relative at the end of this year or next I'm not ready but death isn't reversible so I'll have to live on

[03/28/2023 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I knew my uncle was going to die for months before he died, whenever I spoke to him I got this feeling that he didn't have long left and felt horrified whenever I saw him because that's all I could think about


[03/28/2023 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I kept thinking that he will be dead before 6 months have passed and it freaked me out


[03/28/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I knew my grest nana was going to die too I told my (1st granddad, not great) that I feel like she will die and he said don't be silly but then September 2018 came around and she did


[03/28/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate it


[03/28/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My granddad is absolutely the next relative I will loose and it will hit me even worse because of the memories we've made


[03/28/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thousands of them


[03/28/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lose not loose


[03/28/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's not a matter of feeling now tho because he has terminal lung cancer


[03/28/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's his birthday in April which is next month but I keep thinking that something bad will happen in april


[03/28/2023 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe he'll suddenly deteriorate and thatll be ig


[03/28/2023 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It


[03/28/2023 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm worried


[03/28/2023 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Hes been doing better recently but I feel like that may be about to fall off a cliff


[03/28/2023 11:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not literally of course but in terms of his health


[03/28/2023 11:36 PM] 5298_
Odd question but how many relatives have you lost?


[03/28/2023 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I lost 5


[03/28/2023 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
1 of them was just a few months after I was born so i don't remember them


[03/28/2023 11:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Actually 6


[03/28/2023 11:37 PM] 5298_
This is definitely nothing but it's an odd coincidence


[03/28/2023 11:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What is


[03/28/2023 11:39 PM] 5298_
Earlier I said
IV
Death
In relation to your April theory because the fourth seal and fourth horseman is Death, 4th seal, 4th month and 4 relatives


[03/28/2023 11:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My 4th relative was my great nana which is the one I knew was going to die


[03/28/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The 3rd one was also my great nana but I didn't know her well it didn't affect me and she had been terminally ill for years


[03/28/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The 2nd one I was too young to conceive the idea of what death meant but i I remember their death


[03/28/2023 11:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My granddads lung cancer is stage 4 I'm sure


[03/28/2023 11:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He went into remission but its grown again


[03/28/2023 11:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He doesn't need chemo for 3 months tho my nana said


[03/28/2023 11:43 PM] 5298_
4 symbolises wholeness, what was solid and can be touched


[03/28/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Have you felt weird about next month


[03/28/2023 11:44 PM] 5298_
Kind of


[03/28/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Because if so it won't be anything to do with him


[03/28/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I don't think


[03/28/2023 11:44 PM] 5298_
Something is coming


[03/28/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's how I feel


[03/28/2023 11:44 PM] 5298_
I don't know when or what but something important and tragic is


[03/28/2023 11:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I've associated that something bad might happen to him because its the first thing that sprung to mind that made sense


[03/28/2023 11:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But something is coming


[03/28/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
Many Frames Theory


[03/28/2023 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
27 29 are numbers that stand out to me because I associate those with my uncle


[03/28/2023 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
23 is an important number too


[03/28/2023 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
His birthday was December 23rd


[03/28/2023 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cole said the other day he keeps seeing 23


[03/28/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
23rd-29th of April is my prediction for a big event but maybe it'll happen at any point in april


[03/28/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Watch us being really wrong


[03/28/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
29th April is also important because its a relatives birthday


[03/28/2023 11:49 PM] 5298_
Watch world peace be achieved next month


[03/28/2023 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Impossible with the balkans and the middle east


[03/28/2023 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Northern Ireland becomes ireland


[03/28/2023 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good prediction


[03/28/2023 11:49 PM] 5298_
BEST MONTH EVER IF SO


[03/28/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WAIT


[03/28/2023 11:51 PM] 5298_
What?


[03/28/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2ND HORSEMEN IS WAR AND IN FEBRRUARY 2022 RUSSIA DECLARED WAR ON UKRAINE


[03/28/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
1ST HORSEMEN IS JUST DISEASES AND SHIT AND COVID TOOK OFF IN JANUARY


[03/28/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Is there a famine rn


[03/28/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want this to be right


[03/28/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
No, Conquest is first, Famine is third


[03/28/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
Conquest, War, Famine, Death


[03/28/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fucks sake


[03/28/2023 11:53 PM] 5298_
Lockdown happened in March


[03/28/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I thought I was onto something


[03/28/2023 11:53 PM] 5298_
Maybe


[03/28/2023 11:54 PM] 5298_
What happened in January '21


[03/28/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Covid


[03/28/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
That was more 2020, I mean specifically in 21


[03/28/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It had its biggest peak in January 2021 tho


[03/28/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
Maybe but what could be seen as conquest?


[03/28/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not a clue


[03/28/2023 11:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2021 - ??
2022 - War
2023 - Famine
2024 - Death


[03/28/2023 11:57 PM] 5298_
I'm only guessing 2021


[03/28/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2024 seems like a death year based on current events


[03/28/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2023 is famine because of the crises ongoing


[03/28/2023 11:57 PM] 5298_

[03/28/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2022 obviously war


[03/28/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
2021 December is when Russians began building troops up on the Ukrainian border or at least when I first heard about it


[03/29/2023 12:02 AM] 5298_
When the first seal is broken conquest is sent unto the Earth
When the second seal is broken war is sent unto the Earth
When the third seal is broken famine is sent unto the Earth
When the fourth seal is broken death is sent unto the Earth
When the fifth seal is broken the martyrs of Death are saved 
When the sixth seal is broken the stars fall to Earth
When the seventh seal is broken the trumpets are cued


[03/29/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
So if there's a lot of Martyrdom in May and meteor showers in June then we know the end is begun

Did i tell you that the woman who allowed my uncle to die abused her previous boyfriend into suicide, left my uncle to die, left another man to die but he survived and tried to go out with an 18 year old boy at the age of 28


[03/29/2023 5:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/29/2023 5:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I feel no sympathy for her I genuinely want to kill her


[03/29/2023 5:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
5 months ago that cunt left him to die


[03/29/2023 6:30 PM] 5298_
Surely that's reasonable suspicion of manslaughter


[03/29/2023 6:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i nearly threw up when i saw sarahs arms today


[03/29/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/29/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyre fucking minging


[03/29/2023 6:37 PM] 5298_
I told you it's fucking horrible


[03/29/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i didnt think it was that bad


[03/29/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i genuinely thought i was either gonna be sick or pass out


[03/29/2023 6:37 PM] 5298_
I only saw a little bit but they were fresh weren't they?


[03/29/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes


[03/29/2023 6:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but like half her arm was exposed and the whole thing was just slits


[03/29/2023 6:38 PM] 5298_
The other time they were scars but only from like one day and there were fucking dozens upon dozens upon dozens of them


[03/29/2023 6:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They werent even scars they were bright red and it was her whole arm every centimere there was a slit


[03/29/2023 6:38 PM] 5298_
It just seems time consuming. Kill yourself and get it over with at that point


[03/29/2023 6:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what im saying


[03/29/2023 6:39 PM] 5298_
Silly little freak


[03/29/2023 6:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
will never understand why people cut their arms


[03/29/2023 6:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
makes no fucking sense


[03/29/2023 6:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
"i dont want to feel this pain anymore" then dont slit your wrists you daft fucking cunt


[03/29/2023 6:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I still feel queasy now


[03/29/2023 6:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
obviously im not as bad as you when it comes to gore but that was a whole other level


[03/29/2023 6:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mate i wasnt lying when i said it was a bar code


[03/29/2023 6:41 PM] 5298_

[03/29/2023 6:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/29/2023 6:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that arm nearly fucking gave me one


[03/29/2023 6:42 PM] 5298_
It wasn't a bar code it was fucking modern art

I left that lesson because eating disorders make me feel light headed and then Will started talking about heroin abuse for some reason and a man who had a hole in his leg from heroin abuse and I was actually shaking I was about to faint so I left

[03/29/2023 6:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im 99% sure the first few times it is supposed to hurt


[03/29/2023 6:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[03/29/2023 6:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
for a woman

[03/29/2023 6:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Everyday its just suffering suffering and more suffering


[03/29/2023 6:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
none of the teachers understand me they just think they do


[03/29/2023 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im gonna start skipping lessons if it means im not suffering


[03/29/2023 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
All the teachers hate me and have something against me


[03/29/2023 7:00 PM] 5298_
Let's just terrorise school


[03/29/2023 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I kept zoning out in pshe for long periods of time which is why i didnt get any work done but miss doesnt care

Mrs. Pharoe called you a spastic and Miss Williamson said she was going to hit you and Mrs. Accent ( I forgot her name ) said she was going to fucking bury you

Mrs Theaker


[03/29/2023 7:04 PM] 5298_
Poor Mr. Theaker


[03/29/2023 7:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then mrs pharoe made a claim that im all happy because men are privileged and that all woman get it hard


[03/29/2023 7:05 PM] 5298_
When did she do that?


[03/29/2023 7:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
immediately after calling me a spas


[03/29/2023 7:05 PM] 5298_
I didn't realise that


[03/29/2023 7:09 PM] 5298_
I'm imagining the sexting lesson will be overly formal. Like an example of a sext is 

"Dear [NAME],

I would like to formally request, if you should so feel inclined to do so, you reply to this formal letter with a photograph of you in any state of undress you feel comfortable in sharing 

Kind regards,

[NAME]"


[03/29/2023 7:10 PM] 5298_
That's what Prince Andrew sends to the local nursery


[03/29/2023 7:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Couldnt i tell mrs pharoe that shes being offensive then she couldnt argue back because that would go against her value of protecting minorities and making sure theyre happy


[03/29/2023 7:10 PM] 5298_
Teachers aren't supposed to share their political beliefs


[03/29/2023 7:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mrs pharoe pretty much does


[03/29/2023 7:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mrs pharoe thinks the life of a women in modern times is so hard even when its the exact opposite but shes telling little kids that theyre oppressed and need to stand up


[03/29/2023 7:12 PM] 5298_
She keeps talking about her views on abortion like they're fact and anyone who disagrees is morally wrong and we know from R.E. that teachers can't share their views on that topic


[03/29/2023 7:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
women footballers get payed much much less because theres no demand to watch them lmfao


[03/29/2023 7:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not a matter of oppression, people just prefer mens football


[03/29/2023 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats one example she always brings up


[03/29/2023 7:13 PM] 5298_
We are oppressed and should stand up but not for the reasons she's on about


[03/29/2023 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
true


[03/29/2023 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
shes trying to make women think theyre super oppressed tho and its just retarded


[03/29/2023 7:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i wonder if she could actually name a single right men have that she doesnt


[03/29/2023 7:14 PM] 5298_
I don't understand why she was so offended about women being given rape alarms


[03/29/2023 7:14 PM] 5298_
Vile people will always exist so why not have measures to stop them?


[03/29/2023 7:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate double standards


[03/29/2023 7:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
women dont really get any consequences for falsely accusing a man of rape, raping a man among a load of other shit


[03/29/2023 7:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
men arent taken seriously


[03/29/2023 7:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
why cant we just truly be equal


[03/29/2023 7:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
is it that hard to not put 1 group of people on a pedestal

Sometimes we see changes in the universe on human time scales. Tycho‚Äôs supernova was observed 450 years ago. Today, its debris clouds still expand away from the explosion site fast enough to have covered a trillion miles in 15 years. #MondayMotivation

At first glance, this image may appear to be a view of stars. Rather, almost all these different colored dots are black holes or entire galaxies. When we add sound, we can hear the data. Music represents the full range of X-ray frequencies collected by @chandraxray.

[04/03/2023 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 9:57 PM] 5298_

[04/03/2023 9:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i need to throw a lot of it out


[04/03/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 10:00 PM] 5298_
My mum keeps asking if I want to invite you over to my house because she thinks I'm fucking depressed and need to talk to people more but I keep saying no because my mum is a... delicate soul and I would say you aren't exactly that


[04/03/2023 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[04/03/2023 10:02 PM] 5298_
I also think it would just be awkward


[04/03/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive started stripping the walls and shit at the back so thats why a lot of random chunks of wallpaper are missing but i stopped doing that wall because i probably realised its best i leave that till last


[04/03/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and also you can see the fucking mold in the corner its that bad


[04/03/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 10:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 10:06 PM] 5298_
I've invited S over before and the first time was alright, for reasons I won't get into to spare my dignity, but the second time was just so awkward, we had nothing to do


[04/03/2023 10:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

My step mum was drinking with her friend when she decided to stay over and she had three kids so they all had to stay in my room, in my bed, so there were four of us in bed and they kept kicking me all night


[04/03/2023 10:13 PM] 5298_
It was fucking hell


[04/03/2023 10:13 PM] 5298_
That mother is a nonce


[04/03/2023 10:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i wouldve honestly ran off


[04/03/2023 10:16 PM] 5298_
I was once over at theirs and I had to get changed but I didn't want to in front of the boys because that's odd so I went onto the landing and the mother came out of her room and stared at me when I was changing my trousers and she said "I'm going to tell Vicki ( my step mum ) that I've seen your willy! I've seen you're willy! I've seen you're willy! I've seen your willy!." I nearly started crying


[04/03/2023 10:17 PM] 5298_

[04/03/2023 10:22 PM] 5298_
I had someone try and make me send nudes to them when they knew I was 12, my friend found their address and sent it to them and they stopped talking to me. There was that mother, what Isabel does to me, catcalling and such, in year 7 a group of like 7 year 11's said they wanted to have an orgy with me, once I was sat on a crowded train and I had to sit next to a stranger and they started caressing my leg


[04/03/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I've never been raped or anything but it's still odd


[04/03/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
I know someone who was raped. I know three actually. One of them told me to kill myself because of it which was odd


[04/03/2023 10:25 PM] 5298_
I didn't rape them, why do I have to die


[04/03/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the hell


[04/03/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
I'm pretty sure that person was bipolar


[04/03/2023 10:27 PM] 5298_
He was a nice person but he could switch and say he wanted me to die and that he was going to kill himself very quickly


[04/03/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sounds like mrs north


[04/03/2023 10:28 PM] 5298_
I've just realised


[04/03/2023 10:28 PM] 5298_
I've known I was a woman for over three years


[04/03/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
I met someone online during lockdown in 2020 - they tried to groom me but that's a different story - and I remember telling them I was a woman


[04/03/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive never been groomed online


[04/03/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant remember any time someones tried to, maybe they have but i knew what they were trying to do


[04/03/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Since freeroam isnt canon in rdr2, whenever you die you should wake up at camp and seem startled like it was a dream

I just saw a video that said that if the fire alarm goes off in the Library of Yale that the cases are immediately put into a vacuum to protect the books but people thought that would kill everyone which it wouldn't buy someone said that human lives are rarer than the books


[04/03/2023 11:41 PM] 5298_
That's just a lie


[04/03/2023 11:42 PM] 5298_
There are 8 billion people and only a handful of copies of that book


[04/03/2023 11:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/03/2023 11:45 PM] 5298_
Depends on the scale


[04/03/2023 11:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/04/2023 12:16 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Sometimes i dont want to kill people in this game


[04/04/2023 12:16 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in gta 5 and that i always do but sometimes in red dead theyre cool


[04/04/2023 12:17 AM] 5298_
In GTA V I'll kill anyone that looks at me but in RDR2 I only kill those I have to


[04/04/2023 12:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In red dead i kill most people but spare the cool guys


[04/04/2023 12:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in gta tho


[04/04/2023 12:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/04/2023 12:18 AM] 5298_
If there was the bounty system in GTA I'd have $1500 everywhere

[04/04/2023 12:18 AM] 5298_
I put all the cheats on I can and fucking blow people up


[04/04/2023 12:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
rhodes is probably my favourite town


[04/04/2023 12:19 AM] 5298_
I get invincibility, superspeed and explosive bullets and run in the military base and steal a tank then go onto the motorway and blow cars up


[04/04/2023 12:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what i do


[04/04/2023 12:19 AM] 5298_
I hate Rhodes


[04/04/2023 12:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i always pretend im leading a rebellion


[04/04/2023 12:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i love rhodes


[04/04/2023 12:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/04/2023 12:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/04/2023 12:21 AM] 5298_
I love Saint Denis' atmosphere, Valentine is probably my favourite town followed closely by Strawberry


[04/04/2023 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I love strawberry too and saint denis


[04/04/2023 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
saint denis feels lively during the day but its eerie at night


[04/04/2023 12:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
whenever i play red dead it always ends in a police shootout


[04/04/2023 12:22 AM] 5298_
Did you know you can rob an illegal distillery in Strawberry


[04/04/2023 12:22 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

The speaker had no success trying to quieten MPs.

The only thing worse than a rich cunt is a zealot of a rich cunt


[04/04/2023 8:51 PM] 5298_
The jobs with the least amount of work pay the best so the 1% can become rich without doing anything and make everyone else do the work to make society function but not give them enough money they can rebel. Money is out lifeline now so when we get to rebellious the people in power cut it and we have to fall in line

There's a mod where you can play as Jack

most the mods are homosexual tho


[04/08/2023 2:55 PM] 5298_
Secret ending 5, Arthur and Micah have passionate gay sex instead of killing each other


[04/08/2023 2:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[04/08/2023 2:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wish there was more endings


[04/08/2023 2:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Other than 2 with 2 variants each


[04/08/2023 2:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wish there was one where a bit further back you couldve chosen to remain loyal to dutch and micah


[04/08/2023 2:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that would be interesting


[04/08/2023 2:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
youd still die but youd live a little longer


[04/08/2023 2:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i wish there was one where you do get sent to new austin so the tb doesnt get as bad and maybe arthur survives


[04/08/2023 2:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
eventually he returns and finds the gang at beaver hollow where he can choose to remain loyal to dutch or stray away and start a life like john


[04/08/2023 2:58 PM] 5298_
Something bad needed to happen to Arthur and the gang


[04/08/2023 2:58 PM] 5298_
RDR1 wouldn't have made sense otherwise


[04/08/2023 2:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
red dead would still make sense whether arthur died or not


[04/08/2023 3:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe for the epilogue you would still be john but youd be searching for arthur dutch and micah


[04/08/2023 3:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or dutch and micah


[04/08/2023 3:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
youre under the assumption that arthur went and started a new quiet life


[04/08/2023 3:00 PM] 5298_
John and Arthur couldn't have fallen out and the gang had to have turned on John


[04/08/2023 3:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but then suddenly instead of dutch bursting through the door its a much older arthur


[04/08/2023 3:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That doesnt matter tho the endings dont have to be canon


[04/08/2023 3:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i just wish there was more flexibility in the story and each choice you made could impact the ending a bit like a tell tale game


[04/08/2023 3:05 PM] 5298_
That would be cool


[04/08/2023 3:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/08/2023 4:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/08/2023 4:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I felt a bit ill but not really then i couldnt sleep for ages but eventually i managed to


[04/08/2023 4:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
at like 3


[04/08/2023 4:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or half 3


[04/08/2023 4:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i woke up again at 10 to 6 but i still felt weird and i thought i had just been lying there for 2 hours trying to sleep and i felt weird


[04/08/2023 4:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i couldnt sleep again for a bit so i looked outside and it was getting light


[04/08/2023 4:02 PM] 5298_
I went to sleep at half 3 because I was up all night on a call with my friend then I had an awful night's sleep. I woke up at 6, then again at 9 then again at 1


[04/08/2023 4:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I swear I woke up at 9


[04/08/2023 4:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

This is going to sound very racist but bare with me. I'm not a Nazi or anti-Semite but Israel is fucking stupid. So is the Vatican. Religious states are so fucking stupid. Countries can have national religions but a country built specifically around a religion is so retarded. Surely the Jews could still live in 'Israel' but not have it be a country and there are a billion catholics, what's the point in having a country if you can't keep your ""citizens""

[04/09/2023 2:52 AM] 5298_
It's like a diluted form of ego death. I feel connected to my body but like my soul is connected to the rest of the universe, as if I'm truly experiencing the universe in its naked form instead of the chaotic turbulence we experience most days. My brain feels heavy in my skull, the air feels thick and my lungs feel light. I'm not worrying about my burdens and troubles. It feels like the mercy of a truly benevolent God.

[04/09/2023 5:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im replaying it because i played the game over a span of 3 years so i dont remember much of the early parts


[04/09/2023 5:30 PM] 5298_
The moment when John uses his shotgun to kill the person attacking the farm in the barn in epilogue one springs to mind. It really shows the return of John Marston


[04/09/2023 5:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like that one


[04/09/2023 5:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/09/2023 5:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I can never decide on a favourite something its either i like it or i dont normally

I'm not sure. I can pick favourite things but I usually find it hard


[04/09/2023 5:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/09/2023 5:36 PM] 5298_

[04/09/2023 5:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
idk how to explain just watch a video on him


[04/09/2023 5:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but in rdr2 you can find his shack where overtime a self portrait will be painted and on a table theres a poem about jimmy brooks that changes depending on whether you spare him or kill him


[04/09/2023 5:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There was a man called Jimmy Brooks 
who was always running into crooks 
till one chased him down 
And he had to talk 
His way round 
That Jimmy isn‚Äôt 
As dumb as he looks


[04/09/2023 5:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats the poem for me


[04/09/2023 5:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
There was a man called Jimmy Brooks 
who was always running into crooks 
But the man from the ferry
found him far too contrary
Now Jimmy's family don't see him very much


[04/09/2023 5:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
poem if you kill him


[04/09/2023 5:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Rdr2 is the best game better


[04/09/2023 5:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cant believe say tlou is better


[04/09/2023 5:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can have a favourite game tho


[04/09/2023 5:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that is red dead by far


[04/09/2023 5:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[04/09/2023 5:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
THEY PULLED KIERANS PANTS DOWN


[04/09/2023 5:50 PM] 5298_
And put gelding tongs on his cock


[04/09/2023 5:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/09/2023 5:59 PM] 5298_
Is he God or something?


[04/09/2023 6:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Kieran or the Strange Man?


[04/09/2023 6:03 PM] 5298_
Strange Man


[04/09/2023 6:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats one of the theories


[04/09/2023 6:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The other ones that spring straight to mind are the grim reaper or the devil


[04/09/2023 6:07 PM] 5298_
More like the devil, giving deals and cursing Armadillo, unable to die, choosing who lives and dies with the Marston's, telling the future, being damned, disappearing, telling the future


[04/09/2023 6:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You know the very very racist shop keeper in armadillo


[04/09/2023 6:08 PM] 5298_
I think


[04/09/2023 6:08 PM] 5298_
The anti-Semite?


[04/09/2023 6:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the anti-semite black hater kkk enjoyer british hater etc etc


[04/09/2023 6:08 PM] 5298_
British hater isn't racist it's logical


[04/09/2023 6:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes ik


[04/09/2023 6:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i watched a video and somewhere it says something about the moon shines in the darkness and probably something to do with armadillo and that guy is called herbet moon he has a picture of the strange man that you can ask him about but he says its just random and he seems incapable of being infected


[04/09/2023 6:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
idk watch the strange man revisted


[04/09/2023 6:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/09/2023 9:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why would that be


[04/09/2023 9:38 PM] 5298_
Have you never just had a great dream you wish you could stay in


[04/09/2023 9:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Idk


[04/09/2023 9:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[04/09/2023 9:39 PM] 5298_
My dreams are far better than reality


[04/09/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_
Well, most aspects are


[04/09/2023 9:44 PM] 5298_
There are certain things in life that give me a joy unrivalled but most of life pales in comparison to my dreams


[04/09/2023 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
All my dreams are very random and i prefer life to them


[04/09/2023 9:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its rare i have a dream that feels real


[04/09/2023 9:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dream every single night


[04/09/2023 9:45 PM] 5298_
My dreams are nonsensical but in the dream they make perfect sense


[04/09/2023 9:47 PM] 5298_
Last night I had a dream that I was at a concert I'm going to in October but I was with my friend instead of my Dad and we were on a mattress right by the stage and instead of playing songs the artist just kept talking to the crowd


[04/09/2023 9:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats the sort of shit in my dreams


[04/09/2023 9:49 PM] 5298_
I'm very excited for that concert


[04/09/2023 10:31 PM] 5298_
Gracei pisses me off so much


[04/09/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_

[04/09/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_
What do you think this was


[04/09/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
My body didn't feel real but my mind and soul did


[04/09/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont even know


[04/09/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I cant tell if that feeling is familiar or not


[04/09/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Derealisation probably


[04/09/2023 10:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive also been getting it alot more recently


[04/09/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
It wasn't derealization


[04/09/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It sounds very similar


[04/09/2023 10:49 PM] 5298_
It was similar but not


[04/09/2023 10:51 PM] 5298_
Derealization makes me feel separate from reality but I felt more connected


[04/09/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh shit yeah


[04/09/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Derealisation does that to me too


[04/09/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
depersonalisation?


[04/09/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I honestly think i get them both


[04/09/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
Kinda


[04/09/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
A little bit


[04/09/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
I felt separate from my body but not what I would define as _I_


[04/09/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont know what to call that


[04/09/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and im guessing you dont either


[04/09/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
No


[04/09/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
Like I said, it was a diluted form of ego death

[04/09/2023 11:45 PM] 5298_
I can't describe how I feel


[04/09/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
I don't think it's depression


[04/09/2023 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probably is


[04/09/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
Maybe


[04/09/2023 11:48 PM] 5298_
I feel devoid of all hope and feel an immense anguish at who I am, what I've done, what I haven't done and what my life is very often


[04/09/2023 11:49 PM] 5298_
But I also laugh and enjoy myself regularly, but most of my life is a numb grey. When I'm watching videos or at school it's mainly numb


[04/09/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's how i feel


[04/09/2023 11:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we're both retarded maybe thats why


[04/09/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
My break and lunch typically consist of standing in the same spot not talking to anyone, then form I just sit there and either read which I enjoy it listen to petty arguments of year 8's and wish the Russians would just nuke already, class I try my best to focus on the work but half the time the teacher isn't actually teaching like in science or I can't concentrate because everyone is screaming at eachother for no reason


[04/09/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wish the russians would nuke already i have quite a bit of self hatred i hate school


[04/09/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
even though my circumstances are shit i still want to experience the universe and nature


[04/09/2023 11:53 PM] 5298_
I love school, I hate students and staff


[04/09/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate both


[04/09/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
apart from the students


[04/09/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the staff hate me and i hate the staff


[04/09/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
The students need to shut the fuck up and stop arguing all the fucking time and the staff need to get a fucking grip, tell the class to shut up and get on with teaching and if they don't shut up kick them out and stop crying all the time, I swear there was a teacher that cried like 10 times.


[04/09/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
No one gives a shit


[04/09/2023 11:58 PM] 5298_
Most of the students are just there to talk to their friends and beat the shit out of people for some reason
The staff don't care about what they're teaching or what they're doing or the students
Even outside of school no one cares. I swear to Christ the last time I saw someone do something kind to someone else was like 7 years ago


[04/09/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate school i hate everything about it


[04/09/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
all the staff despise me because they force me into a room for 6 hours a day they force me to write and listen and sit there and then at the end of the day when i act up because of all that they scream at me


[04/09/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and when i dont go in they fine my parents


[04/10/2023 12:00 AM] 5298_
I feel fucking trapped. I don't feel like I can get better. There are two options, live in the anguish and grey or kill myself but I won't do that because I'd faint before I even try so I'm left with the former no matter what


[04/10/2023 12:00 AM] 5298_
I have about 5 things that make me happy


[04/10/2023 12:02 AM] 5298_
Reading;
Writing;
Music;
My Dad;
My girlfriend
And that's it, everything else is either nothing or misery


[04/10/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to spend time in nature but when if i was alone in the woods id be paranoid


[04/10/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i get paranoid that someones going to find me and kill me


[04/10/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
I'd happily go with you


[04/10/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik but theres no real big woods in barrow


[04/10/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i hate that


[04/10/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they destroyed all the forests

i want to move away from this country


[04/10/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
There's Sowerby which is something


[04/10/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its tiny tho


[04/10/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
I wish I could just go to the lakes for a day and my parents not be worried


[04/10/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The lakes would be fine i dont think many people would be out to kill you there


[04/10/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im a very anxious person tho im trying to get past it


[04/10/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont know why i worry for literally no reason


[04/10/2023 12:06 AM] 5298_
I do that


[04/10/2023 12:07 AM] 5298_
There's been so many times I've wanted to talk to someone and I've tried to build up the courage and it takes like 10 minutes and at that point it's just awkward so I don't


[04/10/2023 12:08 AM] 5298_
Like imagine noticing someone look at you, then they just stand there in silence for 10 minutes and then come up to you, you'd probably call the fucking police


[04/10/2023 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate being completely lonely or thinking that nobodies around cause it makes me feel stranded


[04/10/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
I like knowing that no one is around but I hate being alone and not knowing


[04/10/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think its the fear of the unknown that causes me so much anxiety


[04/10/2023 12:10 AM] 5298_
My brain is too erratic to contemplate my life and how to make myself happier


[04/10/2023 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sowerby woods is beautiful but tiny


[04/10/2023 12:11 AM] 5298_

I'm so thankful that drugs make me pass out


[04/10/2023 12:20 AM] 5298_

[04/10/2023 12:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Then we found a cool spot in the abbey


[04/10/2023 4:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/10/2023 4:18 PM] 5298_
I couldn't be arsed to walk over an hour in the rain by myself to Dalton


[04/10/2023 4:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/10/2023 4:19 PM] 5298_
I'm not sure of the political basis of Dalton but it's a lovely town


[04/10/2023 4:19 PM] 5298_
I prefer it to Barrow


[04/10/2023 4:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think for voting the entire country should be split into counties of 50,000 people or something like that


[04/10/2023 4:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
actually more representation for more rural areas


[04/10/2023 4:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Actually no


[04/10/2023 4:21 PM] 5298_
How is that democratic


[04/10/2023 4:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
SHUT UP


[04/10/2023 4:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I like the idea of 50,000 people counties


[04/10/2023 4:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or around that


[04/10/2023 4:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cause it is alright just trust me


[04/10/2023 4:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How is it not democratic


[04/10/2023 4:22 PM] 5298_
I think I've read it wrong


[04/10/2023 4:22 PM] 5298_
I'm very tired and my eyes don't work


[04/10/2023 4:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Only issue is barrow would be split in 2


[04/10/2023 4:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
every 100,000 people


[04/10/2023 4:32 PM] 5298_
The traitor makes no sense

It looks like theres a plan to reforest the whole furness peninsula


[04/10/2023 4:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and a lot of areas surrounding major cumbrian towns


[04/10/2023 4:59 PM] 5298_
Woohooo


[04/10/2023 5:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Well not all of it but the vast majority of it


[04/10/2023 5:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
This is from early 2021 but i found it and i feel happy


[04/10/2023 5:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the project will be underway by now or im guessing so but the trees will be very young and they wont have covered the whole area they want probably


[04/10/2023 5:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i hope they reforest it properly instead of just planting trees and calling it a day


[04/10/2023 5:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The project is underway and has been since 2021 actually its just the area is so big that im not even sure theyll be working on barrow yet


[04/10/2023 5:01 PM] 5298_
I did see loads of planted trees when I was driving up to the lakes

[04/10/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/10/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Tesla was sick but Newton is far above any other mind


[04/10/2023 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I actually wonder what the world would be like if we listened to tesla


[04/10/2023 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I keep getting Mr. Beast tiktoks which already is a tragedy in of itself but they're all really homophobic


[04/10/2023 11:48 PM] 5298_
Like death threats


[04/10/2023 11:48 PM] 5298_
Not homophobic


[04/10/2023 11:48 PM] 5298_
Transphobic


[04/10/2023 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They arent death threats bro üíÄ


[04/10/2023 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i keep seeing them too


[04/10/2023 11:49 PM] 5298_
You should see some of the fucking comments


[04/10/2023 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
some of the comments are taking the piss or saying old chris would make fun of new chris


[04/10/2023 11:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or vast majority


[04/10/2023 11:50 PM] 5298_
Still vile


[04/10/2023 11:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nah but the thing is hes threatening to sue people over it bro unless hes joking


[04/10/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in fact he says he is suing them bro


[04/10/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and if hes joking thats already against the law im sure


[04/10/2023 11:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but also he doesnt have a good case


[04/10/2023 11:52 PM] 5298_
The sueing is retarded but that's still no reason to be rampantly transphobic


[04/10/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when sudden change happens on a level like that theres gonna be a lot of backlash regardless especially when most their fans are teenage or young people lmao


[04/10/2023 11:54 PM] 5298_
Yeah, massive retards


[04/10/2023 11:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I do have a question but its not really related to mr beast or chris


[04/10/2023 11:55 PM] 5298_
Which is


[04/10/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Do you think gender dysphoria is a mental illness in some way (sorry if i worded that horribly im just curious and also its good fuel for discussion i think)


[04/10/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
No


[04/10/2023 11:56 PM] 5298_
Not really


[04/10/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Whys that


[04/10/2023 11:57 PM] 5298_
I think it's the same thing as like autism if that makes sense


[04/10/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A spectrum


[04/10/2023 11:57 PM] 5298_
No


[04/10/2023 11:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Was gonna say


[04/10/2023 11:57 PM] 5298_
Well, yes


[04/10/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh


[04/10/2023 11:59 PM] 5298_
But I think it's like, autism is a mental...disorder but I wouldn't say it's a negative thing. Which I would say gender dysphoria is


[04/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats what i mean


[04/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i guess its sort of a bad thing because it can cause depression and shit


[04/10/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not just sort of it probably is


[04/11/2023 12:01 AM] 5298_
For me it's like what I think is my facial dysmorphia. My facial dysmorphia makes me hate my face and I feel happier when I wear my mask and my gender dysphoria makes me hate my body and then when I present more feminine I feel happier


[04/11/2023 12:01 AM] 5298_
I'd say it's more like facial dysmorphia then


[04/11/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
I don't know how I didn't know I was trans earlier


[04/11/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
I was like 8 and I would literally dream that I was a woman and I woke up ecstatic and thought it was normal


[04/11/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Bro i swear i had gender dysphoria for a short time in my life when i was like 7 or something


[04/11/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
idk bro i wanted to be a girl for like a month then snapped out of it

[04/11/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i never felt that way before it


[04/11/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
I'd say you should think about that but I don't know, if you've never felt like that since it might have just been some weird thing, just a random thought


[04/11/2023 12:10 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Intrusive ass thoughts ong ‚ò†Ô∏è üíÄ


[04/11/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That was also the same time i started reaching contact with the internet bro i swear down


[04/11/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that mightve been some coincidence shit or the internet instantly makes you lgbt


[04/11/2023 12:12 AM] 5298_
I don't think it was gender dysphoria, gender dysphoria is feeling hatred towards being your sex and an innate desire to have the body of the opposite sex, not even all trans people have gender dysphoria


[04/11/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How tf do not all trans people have gender dysphoria


[04/11/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
why is that hard for me to grasp


[04/11/2023 12:13 AM] 5298_
No, there have been LGBT people throughout all of history


[04/11/2023 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fairs but also the internet actually sends the 5g signals into your cock then it activates wifi scanner mode and then it infiltrates you üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ !!! ü¶Ö


[04/11/2023 12:14 AM] 5298_
You can want to be a different gender while being content with your body, I usually don't even have gender dysphoria often


[04/11/2023 12:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/11/2023 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I mean I did discover the 23 enigma so maybe that's why but maybe it's not


[04/11/2023 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I've just watched a video and it's made me furious for some odd reason


[04/11/2023 12:53 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What video


[04/11/2023 12:54 AM] 5298_
It was some guy reacting to a new song from an artist I like and it's just such a nothing video


[04/11/2023 12:56 AM] 5298_
It pissed me off, he just played the song occasionally pausing and saying "I like that line" then continuing then at the end it's just him gloating I guess. It's just him saying that 'most people won't listen to this because they can't sing along but me, I'm a rapper and I can actually keep up so I like it, you guys won't though because you can't sing along' and it just fucking infuriated me


[04/11/2023 1:02 AM] 5298_
I think I'm just going a bit coocoo


[04/11/2023 1:06 AM] 5298_

[04/11/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I got an amazing idea


[04/11/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
Which is


[04/11/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im gonna make an alt


[04/11/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
after i finished making my server


[04/11/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then im gonna join all those shitty weather servers and tear them all apart


[04/11/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
by that i mean start a massive fight


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then for some reason whenever theres 'drama' the server just dies


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so theyll see my brand new shiny server thats just ultimately better


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and theyll flock to it


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and if it doesnt kill them then ill be sad


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cause then ill just have to wait for them to naturally fall apart


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] 5298_
Bros a genius


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it happens to each of them tho


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats the thing


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they always die because someone comes in and fights with everyone


[04/11/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and that


[04/11/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and if they dont die the first or second time then eventually everyone finds a new server


[04/11/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and you know what that server would be


[04/11/2023 11:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would be MINE


[04/11/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then ill get a loan from the bank


[04/11/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and start doing giveaways and shit to keep my server active


[04/11/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then BOOM


[04/11/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WERE IN BUSINESS


[04/11/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then i start a channel dedicated to weather and that


[04/11/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then get views raking in


[04/11/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cause nobody can be arsed to make good weather content


[04/11/2023 11:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

So you're just doing the server for the capitalism

yep


[04/11/2023 11:27 PM] 5298_

[04/11/2023 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think youd be interested in meteorology in some way


[04/11/2023 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the deeper you go the more you understand the physics and shit involved


[04/11/2023 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/11/2023 11:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if you join any servers do not mention me or my name


[04/11/2023 11:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or that you know me irl


[04/11/2023 11:29 PM] 5298_
I might also copy you and try make a server for summet


[04/11/2023 11:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/11/2023 11:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dont even say where you live


[04/11/2023 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Yeah fuck that


[04/11/2023 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the most specific i said was south lakeland in reference to a storm i could see that was in like the pennines or something


[04/11/2023 11:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i always said i was from cumbria


[04/11/2023 11:30 PM] 5298_
Most specific I'll get is England, usually I just say UK


[04/11/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/11/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its easy to track weather if you couldnt guess

[04/11/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
also the basics of meteorology are kinda easy to pick up


[04/11/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its just convection


[04/11/2023 11:38 PM] 5298_
Like I wanted to do a history based server but I wanted to do like

Idea: I make a place for people to compile historic facts and shit, people can talk about things they're interested in and grow an organised area to learn anything historic


[04/12/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
Obviously sources will need to be provided for anything to be allowed within the archive ( I believe that's the right word )


[04/12/2023 10:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/12/2023 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Go ahead


[04/12/2023 10:20 PM] 5298_
A place for people to archive any historic facts ( with sources provided ) and talk about anything history related. Facts can be from mainstream or personal history as long as credible sources are provided. For personal history any tangible evidence that will not breach personal privacy should be sourced and if there is none to provide then a primary source will need to be provided. Our mission is to create an extensive, easily accessible archive of all things historic.


[04/12/2023 10:20 PM] 5298_
That will be displayed on everything related to the archive


[04/12/2023 10:23 PM] 5298_
How's Windsome coming along?


[04/12/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/12/2023 10:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to set up a service like windy.com but without everything locked up behind a paywall


[04/12/2023 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they used to be so free but then they locked half the main stuff behind a paywall


[04/12/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
I'll have a free website with like a donations thing for people who like the archive to donate to 'help make the archive better' and also buy me cool things but they don't need to know that


[04/12/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_
Are we doing anything with ROF and NW?


[04/12/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_
I might repurpose the twitter for the archive


[04/12/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/12/2023 11:45 PM] 5298_
I have a plan for the pillars, tell me what you think and if it's shit I'll go with your idea


[04/12/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
I'm going to colour them with the colours of the Olympic rings because they're a well known colour scheme of unity across the world and for the continent's and shit

[04/13/2023 12:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Something about it feels complicated


[04/13/2023 12:18 AM] 5298_
It is a bit busy but I like it


[04/13/2023 12:19 AM] 5298_
I think it represents the archive well and it's not too complicated, it's also very recognisable


[04/13/2023 12:27 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
something simpler ig tho not much meaning to it admittedly

Maybe could add the colours to the IHA


[04/13/2023 12:30 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
could probs use different colours of unity


[04/13/2023 12:31 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
olympic ring colours look funny


[04/13/2023 12:31 AM] 5298_
True


[04/13/2023 12:31 AM] 5298_
I want it to be international because IHA means International History Archive


[04/13/2023 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Green? blue?


[04/13/2023 12:36 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Could even just have a museum symbol without the text


[04/13/2023 12:39 AM] 5298_
That's not very unique though is it, if someone saw that they would think museum not IHA

[04/13/2023 1:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
rdr2 story will always be on top tho


[04/13/2023 1:32 AM] 5298_
I think it'll be good


[04/13/2023 1:32 AM] 5298_
I have faith in Rockstar


[04/13/2023 1:33 AM] 5298_
I hope after GTAVI we get a RDR1 remake then RDR3


[04/13/2023 1:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
after gta 6 itll be rdr3


[04/13/2023 1:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then after rdr3 itll be gta7


[04/13/2023 1:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
unless they make a new series


[04/13/2023 1:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if they make a new one it should be some pirate shit man


[04/13/2023 1:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but rdr2 was a very very very good selling game


[04/13/2023 1:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i reckon theyll just make another red dead game


[04/13/2023 1:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe it wouldnt be red dead redemption but red dead something else


[04/13/2023 1:35 AM] 5298_
I hope they make a RDR1 remake as like a little thing between the two big games so I can okay all of rdr


[04/13/2023 1:43 AM] 5298_
Nah bro fuck is that, how you attracted to that?

I have a problem and I can't think of the solution


[04/13/2023 8:14 PM] 5298_
I need IHA to be interactive but regulated. People need to be able to post but it can't be anything so I'll have to find a way to check the content of the post to see if it's 
A) historical
B) True
C) Has a source


[04/13/2023 8:14 PM] 5298_
Maybe an AI but an AI wouldn't know fact from fiction


[04/13/2023 8:15 PM] 5298_
A verification process where before a post is put into the archive someone has to check it but that would be heavily time consuming and without a group of people working on it if the archive gets large enough it just won't work


[04/13/2023 8:16 PM] 5298_
Small scale a verification process would work but it's not feasible if it gets large enough


[04/13/2023 8:56 PM] 5298_
I've had an idea


[04/13/2023 9:00 PM] 5298_
An AI goes through and checks for a source and organises the fact then it's published. If someone disagrees with a part of the fact they can say why in a complaint. There will be a symbol for when a fact has a complaint and a moderator will read the complaint, check the fact and either delete the fact if it's wrong or delete the complaint and mark the fact as true, when a fact is true it can't have complaints. If someone thinks a fact marked true is false then they can write an email with a link to the fact and why they think it's wrong, if the complaint is wrong the person will be given a mark, five marks and they aren't allowed to upload facts or write complaints

It's kind of like Wikipedia but for purely history and a bit more interactive


[04/13/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

People upload historic facts, an AI checks to see if there is a source and if people disagree with the fact they can write a complaint that an actual human will go through and verify it, once a fact is verified it will be marked as true

18. It's perfectly okay for someone to be uncomfortable with discussing rape and sexual misconduct. Sex is a taboo subject whether we like it or not and people are bound to be uncomfortable discussing such a violent and disgusting thing

34. Making light of something can be a coping mechanism, I make light of problems in my life because if I don't I'd never be happy 

36. Why isn't it okay to be proud that someone found you physically attractive enough to have sex with you, if a lot of people find you that attractive of course you're going to be proud of that fact 

42. Don't even know what this means but periods are disgusting and I'm allowed to feel disgusted by them. Being sick is a perfectly natural thing that all people go through, it doesn't mean I want to discuss it or that I'm not disgusted by it

54. Being accused of rape is life ending. Your friends will most likely leave you, your family leave you and you'll be fired from your job and probably never hired again, of course it's terrifying to be falsely accused

55. Objectifying specific women is wrong but you're allowed to discuss what you like. Think of it like a pet, obviously you take care of your pet and love your pet but you still have particular characteristics you like; I'm not equating women to pets but it's a good analogy

normally at least


[04/16/2023 1:11 AM] 5298_
I have a wide taste but it's generally defined as some form of indie-pop usually although it's still different and I have fringe artists I listen to


[04/16/2023 1:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I just like shit with strong bass


[04/16/2023 1:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like phonk but thats normally the same thing copied and pasted


[04/16/2023 1:13 AM] 5298_
The Oh Hellos, Blue Foster and Foot Ox are indie-pop but Foot Ox is fucking weird. NF is rap which I don't listen to pretty much at all but I love him, I even have a signed cd. Crywank describes themselves as anti-folk and they're very good

[04/16/2023 9:58 PM] 5298_
I think it's so fucking stupid that instead of trying to help you and accommodate you most teachers just shout and you and send you to time out which isn't even the purpose of it


[04/16/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
all the teachers are like that


[04/16/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mrs pharoah is cool tho


[04/16/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mrs pharoah has some very strange political views but it means she treats me like a person whereas rest of the teachers dont


[04/16/2023 9:59 PM] 5298_
Mr. Stockton is so stupid


[04/16/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/16/2023 10:00 PM] 5298_
I still don't like him


[04/16/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

When people ( mainly Chanel and Gracey ) talk in lesson instead of using any form of discipline he just joins in the conversation so no one is learning because instead of teaching the class he's having a conversation with these two 13 year olds

[04/16/2023 11:59 PM] 5298_
It wasn't


[04/16/2023 11:59 PM] 5298_
That's just what my eyes used to be like


[04/17/2023 12:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
bro my mum got some head and shoulder knock off and told me to use it my face cause it clears it up and its cleared mine up a bit


[04/17/2023 12:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like normally i have a few spots on my chin but since i started applying it theyve gone


[04/17/2023 12:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
still there on my nose


[04/17/2023 12:00 AM] 5298_
Yeah my dad got some spots stuff but it made me want to peel my face off


[04/17/2023 12:00 AM] 5298_
Under my nose is really red


[04/17/2023 12:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my nose is just gonna be acne scars in the future


[04/17/2023 12:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my nose goes like that


[04/17/2023 12:01 AM] 5298_
I hate how my face looks but I don't mind how literally everything else looks


[04/17/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think my face is fine sometimes and sometimes i dont like it


[04/17/2023 12:02 AM] 5298_
I've always hated my face


[04/17/2023 12:02 AM] 5298_
It's better now but I still don't like it


[04/17/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like by night time i look normal but in the morning my face puffs up fucking loads compared to most people


[04/17/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i look like im allergic to air


[04/17/2023 12:03 AM] 5298_
If I had a different face I think I'd be happier and not self conscious about how I look


[04/17/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
It's annoying that people always ask me why I wear my mask, most of the time it's the same people asking repeatedly


[04/17/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
I can't come up with a good answer without just getting really personal


[04/17/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
most people just think you still think covids around


[04/17/2023 12:07 AM] 5298_
Some people have seriously told me covid doesn't exist anymore


[04/17/2023 12:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it pretty much doesnt


[04/17/2023 12:07 AM] 5298_
One said it's not real anymore


[04/17/2023 12:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
obviously it does


[04/17/2023 12:08 AM] 5298_
A lot of people in 2020 that didn't wear masks when it was mandatory said that covid wasn't harmful


[04/17/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
I'm going to lose my mind in the hub


[04/17/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think every virus is harmful


[04/17/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
FUCK SCHOOL


[04/17/2023 12:10 AM] 5298_
The TA's have just given up for the most part


[04/17/2023 12:10 AM] 5298_
It's weird how different I am from year 7


[04/17/2023 12:11 AM] 5298_
But it's interesting to see what's stayed the same


[04/17/2023 12:12 AM] 5298_
In year 7 I would never even dream of breaking any rules, I thought it was disgusting and every rule is set in place for a purpose and authority is never unjust and now I skip a lot of lessons and I'm IRA


[04/17/2023 12:12 AM] 5298_
But I still care a lot about tests and doing well


[04/17/2023 12:13 AM] 5298_
I've always hated getting below 65%, if I get lower than that I feel awful and if it's between 65-75% I'm still disappointed


[04/17/2023 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Bro i was the same


[04/17/2023 12:15 AM] 5298_
I'm one bad day away of throwing shit in class and screaming


[04/17/2023 12:16 AM] 5298_
I've thought about going to classes I hate and for the whole time just telling Isabel to shut up every time she says something


[04/17/2023 12:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fr


[04/17/2023 12:18 AM] 5298_
I feel selfish thinking this but I wonder why no one in the hub has tried to seriously talk to me about how I am


[04/17/2023 12:19 AM] 5298_
Obviously I'm in there for a reason but they've also seen me absolutely sob on there and hit desks and screamed at people and hide in F1 crying in the corner shouting at anyone who came in and they don't bat an eye


[04/17/2023 12:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik they are all knobs


[04/17/2023 12:21 AM] 5298_
They also need to learn that if I ask to be alone I need to be alone, when I hid in F1 Mrs. Ritchie came in to see what was wrong and I told her to leave and was hitting shit and she didn't and I was so close to just throttling her


[04/17/2023 12:22 AM] 5298_
One of these days I'm going to have another breakdown and they aren't going to listen and I'm going to end up being suspended


[04/17/2023 12:22 AM] 5298_
There should be places for people to be alone


[04/17/2023 12:24 AM] 5298_
There's been so many times where I've needed to be alone and knowing that there was no where I could be alone in the whole school and that I couldn't escape any of it sent me into a panic attack


[04/17/2023 12:29 AM] 5298_
I hate when teachers ask you "what would you do to help with this situation" when you're there for help. If I knew how to solve the problem I wouldn't be there asking for help I would be solving the problem


[04/17/2023 12:31 AM] 5298_
I feel forgotten in school


[04/17/2023 12:33 AM] 5298_
The only time teachers ever talk to me in class is when they give me my test back and the hub doesn't care about me. I'm supposed to have a checkup everyday from my keyworker as a replacement for morning form but on the last three weeks of school no one talked to me at all


[04/17/2023 12:34 AM] 5298_
I don't feel like a student or even a commodity I feel like a piece of furniture that's always there so you don't notice it


[04/17/2023 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im meant to have a worker checkup on me at the end of every month but last time i heard from them was november or january


[04/17/2023 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its been that long i cant even remember


[04/17/2023 12:35 AM] 5298_
New Wendigoon video, guess that means I'm not sleeping


[04/17/2023 12:35 AM] 5298_

[04/17/2023 12:36 AM] 5298_

[04/17/2023 12:37 AM] 5298_

HOW


[04/17/2023 1:51 AM] 5298_
In junior school we had a massive woods that had been fenced off but the school owned it and every month we would have a day where we did ""fun"" things that was basically two turns of doing work for the school like cleaning and shit and one turn of playing in the woods and once my friend and I found an area right at the back that no one else knew about and we hid there just playing games and shit and then the teacher shouted everyone back and must have miss counted because they left and locked the gate, like 10 minutes later we realised how quite it was and left out hiding spot and had a look around and found no one and just kinda ran around, we only got let out at third break when everyone was at brake and heard is shouting at the gate

Good and Bad are each other. If you live a good and virtuous life you will face many hardships and troubles but it will be worth it for the ultimate satisfaction of self fulfillment or whatever your faith believes. If you live a bad and selfish life then you will face many nice and good things but it will not be worth it for the discontent and ill will others will wish upon you for your evil life or whatever torture your faith believes. Good leads to bad leads to good. Bad leads to good leads to bad.

The CBDC is going to make all money electronic and get rid of normal banks, so our current banks will be dissolved and our money will be put in this new app that comes on all phones and we go straight through the English Bank when we buy anything so the government can see everything we buy and where we buy it from which currently isn't the case, right now only your bank can see and they're legally not allowed to share purchase history, the money from the banks is collected and given to the Central Bank of England and then distributed to where it needs to be with no reference of who bought what but with the new system the government can see who buys what


[04/19/2023 12:31 AM] 5298_

[04/19/2023 12:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[04/19/2023 12:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ffs man


[04/19/2023 12:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Should I execute it


[04/19/2023 12:53 AM] 5298_
Yes


[04/19/2023 12:55 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
BRO THE HEAD IS STILL STUCK IN MY SKIN


[04/19/2023 12:59 AM] 5298_
I don't know what to do with science


[04/19/2023 1:01 AM] 5298_
I'm fucked


[04/19/2023 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Bro knowing my luck and the fact it's April means I am going to get Lyme disease


[04/19/2023 1:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And I'm gonna be in pain


[04/19/2023 1:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That little fucker


[04/19/2023 1:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If Lyme disease was fatal I would be very naughty


[04/19/2023 1:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fuck this


[04/19/2023 1:07 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If I got Lyme disease even if it doesn't last ages I will kill myself


[04/19/2023 1:11 AM] 5298_
Well that's not very good


[04/19/2023 1:12 AM] 5298_
A GP will treat you for Lyme Disease


[04/19/2023 1:12 AM] 5298_
It's America where they refuse to treat it because they don't think it's real


[04/19/2023 1:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why tho


[04/19/2023 1:13 AM] 5298_
They're American


[04/19/2023 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I'm gonna see if my mum will take me to a doctor tomorrow because even tho it can take ages for symptoms to show up I wanna be safe


[04/19/2023 1:18 AM] 5298_
That's probably best


[04/19/2023 1:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was on my neck too


[04/19/2023 1:19 AM] 5298_
You're going to die on the 23rd fr


[04/19/2023 1:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nah Lyme disease ain't fatal


[04/19/2023 1:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If you don't treat it your face paralysed and you get arthritis and shit


[04/19/2023 1:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Gets


[04/19/2023 1:20 AM] 5298_
I need to catch up in science and try and stay in lessons more


[04/19/2023 1:21 AM] 5298_
I'll check Google classroom and see if the lessons have been uploaded so I can go through everything


[04/19/2023 1:21 AM] 5298_
If I fail science I will probably kill myself


[04/19/2023 1:22 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fuck science lessons


[04/19/2023 1:22 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Can never ever focus or do work in them


[04/19/2023 1:22 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate everything about school


[04/19/2023 1:22 AM] 5298_
Me neither but if I don't try and learn anything I'll hate myself


[04/19/2023 1:23 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I've been feeling a little less anxious now that I've been hitting gym


[04/19/2023 1:30 AM] 5298_
How does that work


[04/19/2023 1:31 AM] 5298_
How could going to the gym correlate to being less anxious


[04/19/2023 1:58 AM] 5298_
There's something wrong with me


[04/19/2023 1:58 AM] 5298_
I'm constantly sad and half the time I don't have a reason


[04/19/2023 1:59 AM] 5298_
I should probably go see someone but I don't see the point


[04/19/2023 1:59 AM] 5298_
It's either I get diagnosed with depression and nothing changes because there isn't a cure or it turns out there's nothing wrong with me and nothing changes because there's nothing to fix


[04/19/2023 2:00 AM] 5298_
Either way I'm still miserable


[04/19/2023 2:05 AM] 5298_
I don't think there's any hope for me but I still try and just "change my philosophy and things will get better" but I know that won't work. There's nothing I can realistically do to be happy. The scariest part of all of it is I constantly get told that I should cherice this time because it's going to get worse. People say there's light at the end of the tunnel but I feel like I've just entered it, the only light is behind me rapidly leaving view as I get consumed by the darkness


[04/19/2023 2:11 AM] 5298_
People say that no one should suffer silently but what else can I do. When I speak up the people I care about think I'm either lying or being a snitch. No one gives a shit about my problems. The few friends I do have view me as just a jester that makes jokes and that's all I do, they don't take interest. You seem to care and talk to me but you're the only one. Even my girlfriend doesn't ask how I am often. I feel like I have to bare my cross as well as everyone else's


[04/19/2023 2:14 AM] 5298_
My life is shallow ecstasies and misery


[04/19/2023 2:16 AM] 5298_
I hope God exists. If He does then I think I'd have hope. Every form of suicide I couldn't perform because of the various things that make me faint, by the time I'm determined to die I'll faint and can't carry it out and if God exists then I'd like to believe He's designed me that way to keep me alive for something, some reason to give my life a meaning or just to make me happy for more than 20 minutes at a time


[04/19/2023 3:42 PM] 5298_
I'll consider going to the gym


[04/19/2023 4:03 PM] 5298_
After a lengthy discussion with Danielle I've decided I'll try and go


[04/19/2023 4:03 PM] 5298_
She said I wouldn't be able to do it because I'm too weak so I'm going to purely to spite her


[04/19/2023 5:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Idek If Im gonna go today


[04/19/2023 5:08 PM] 5298_

Yola language
Yola, historically the Forth and Bargy dialect, is a revived Anglic language once spoken widely in the baronies of Forth and Bargy in County Wexford, Ireland. It is thought to have evolved from Middle English, which was brought to Ireland during the Norman invasion, beginning in 1169. As such, it was similar to the Fingallian language of the Fin...

[04/21/2023 6:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
curiosity killed the cat


[04/21/2023 6:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im assuming being stoned once wont get me hooked


[04/21/2023 6:20 PM] 5298_
But satisfaction brought it back


[04/21/2023 6:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
max got stoned once to see what its like and he says he doesnt have any intention of smoking it again


[04/21/2023 6:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nor does he feel the urge to


[04/21/2023 6:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then satisfaction shot it 100 times cause its a cat


[04/21/2023 6:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/21/2023 7:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i destroyed the dam but then it formed another channel to that spot of the beach i showed and then after a week or 2 i came back and it was a pond


[04/21/2023 7:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and it was there for a while


[04/21/2023 7:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
mustve started it off but rain and maybe high tide idk kept it going


[04/21/2023 7:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
either that or it was always there and just big coincidence


[04/21/2023 7:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/21/2023 7:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think it will prevail against russia


[04/21/2023 7:29 PM] 5298_
Russia will try again


[04/21/2023 7:29 PM] 5298_
If Russia fails it will try again in a few years


[04/21/2023 7:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
russias been slowly creeping over their territory for a while now


[04/21/2023 7:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its a slow creep but its in favour of russians


[04/21/2023 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
could take a year


[04/21/2023 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
could take 2 years


[04/21/2023 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
could take a decade


[04/21/2023 7:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i think russia will eventually come out on top


[04/21/2023 7:31 PM] 5298_
Everything East of the Iron Curtain is in Russia's sights, they'll go there next. They only went to Ukraine first because they're not NATO


[04/21/2023 7:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ukraine was always a shit hole anyway


[04/21/2023 7:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
overglorified shithole


[04/21/2023 7:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
before the war nobody had even heard of ukraine or cared


[04/21/2023 7:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the only thing they knew about it was chernobyl


[04/21/2023 7:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but now we make a big deal


[04/21/2023 7:32 PM] 5298_
Belarus is next I guarantee it


[04/21/2023 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the only real influence that country had was fucking grain exports


[04/21/2023 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
belarus is next and that doesnt matter


[04/21/2023 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyre pretty much russian anyway


[04/21/2023 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
government is highly pro russian


[04/21/2023 7:32 PM] 5298_
It does because after Ukraine and Belarus they only have NATO ex-soviet countries left


[04/21/2023 7:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and why would they come after nato


[04/21/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
theyre scared of nato otherwise world war 3 wouldve happened a long time ago


[04/21/2023 7:33 PM] 5298_
They want USSR land back


[04/21/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they went for ukraine because it WASNT in nato


[04/21/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they do but they know they cant get it


[04/21/2023 7:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
now that finlands joined that attempt has been shut down but the finns are cool anyway so if war did happen they wouldve won


[04/21/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
nato and russia both know that a war between them would be fucking horrid and both sides are scared of war


[04/21/2023 7:34 PM] 5298_
I think Russia's allies will join in


[04/21/2023 7:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
china doesnt really support the russian invasion


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] 5298_
I think Russia will promise to help them with something


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
china isnt much of a russian ally to begin with


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
well they are


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but they arent


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but they also are


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] 5298_
Maybe anti-american but who knows


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ukraine supply shit has been taken from bakhmut anyway


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] 5298_
They're less of an ally with Russia and more an ally with communism


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly


[04/21/2023 7:35 PM] 5298_
All of them are


[04/21/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think putin is more going for a russian empire than a ussr tho


[04/21/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he wants the glory of the ussr but not have the communist bit


[04/21/2023 7:37 PM] 5298_
North Korea is just leaching off Russia's scraps, China is only allies with them because no one else wants to because China has fucked over the whole world and Russia is trying to use both of them I guarantee


[04/21/2023 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
China is gonna be the next super power and the us is going to shit anyway


[04/21/2023 7:37 PM] 5298_
The US has been going to shit since it's inception


[04/21/2023 7:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it peaked a long time ago


[04/21/2023 7:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its losing grip over the world


[04/21/2023 7:38 PM] 5298_
I think the decline mainly happened post WWII


[04/21/2023 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its sped up in recent years


[04/21/2023 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/21/2023 8:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and casualty isnt exactly death so if its the same guy he fought as a german in world war 1 underage got shot on the eastern front survived then moved to barrow


[04/21/2023 8:42 PM] 5298_
Why is the residence blurred

that is crazy ong


[04/21/2023 8:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but im guessing viktor wlodarczyk was a german


[04/21/2023 8:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he has a polish last name so i assume his father was from polish descent but mother couldve been of german descent but eastern poland was always polish in germany


[04/21/2023 8:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
these are all the same people

What the fuck


[04/21/2023 8:52 PM] 5298_
I've used the remember password thing and it's saying it's wrong


[04/21/2023 8:55 PM] 5298_
Unknown but I'll try and find it


[04/21/2023 8:58 PM] 5298_
It doesn't say


[04/21/2023 8:58 PM] 5298_
There isn't a category for death


[04/21/2023 8:58 PM] 5298_
He died around 1981 though


[04/21/2023 8:59 PM] 5298_
I can't remember if he died just before or just after my dad's birth


[04/21/2023 9:00 PM] 5298_
So it's anywhere from 1980-1981 or depending on what my dad classifies and not meeting it could be a few years later but my best guess is late 1980- early 1981

[04/22/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_
To fix the voting system we need to vote on it, and with a corrupt voting system one that doesn't favour the current government won't be voted in. I don't think any of that makes sense


[04/22/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
most lgbt celebrities are only doing it for attention and brownie points


[04/22/2023 11:59 PM] 5298_
Like who


[04/22/2023 11:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

LMFAO


[04/23/2023 12:01 AM] 5298_
I think there's a big difference between a lgbt celebrity and a celebrity that's lgbt


[04/23/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what is that difference


[04/23/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i worded that shid rong ‚ò†Ô∏è


[04/23/2023 12:02 AM] 5298_
If they're famous and LGBT I couldn't give a shit but if they're famous because they're LGBT then that's where the problems arise


[04/23/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
people only knew lil nas x because of old town road and then after he faded into obscurity he came out and as gay and thats why hes famous now


[04/23/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
his music sucks ass


[04/23/2023 12:02 AM] 5298_
It does


[04/23/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sam smith is famous cause he pretends to be something


[04/23/2023 12:03 AM] 5298_
It's like the people who make being lgbt a personality trait


[04/23/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i feel like most gen z lgbt members make it their personality


[04/23/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like every aspect of their life is lgbt shit


[04/23/2023 12:03 AM] 5298_
Being lgbt is a part of someone's personality but it shouldn't be their personality


[04/23/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and theyre only lgbt because some celebs came out as gay and people like to follow shit blindly


[04/23/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly


[04/23/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the ones who put gay dogwoman and shit in their bio with the lgbt flag behind character pfps


[04/23/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and that


[04/23/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
I don't think I do it, being lgbt only affects what it naturally does


[04/23/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
I do have my WhatsApp background as a pride flag thing but that's manly because I think it looks pretty


[04/23/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im certain that most gen z members of lgbt are honestly going through a phase


[04/23/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like emos and shit


[04/23/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ik a lot of people say it


[04/23/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and a lot of people disagree


[04/23/2023 12:07 AM] 5298_
I partially agree


[04/23/2023 12:07 AM] 5298_
I went through phases but it ultimately helped me discover who I am


[04/23/2023 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel like the whole lgbt movement in gen z is geared by celebs wanting attention and making everything about gayness


[04/23/2023 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
just like the rise and fall of emos


[04/23/2023 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
give it 10 years everyone will be straight again


[04/23/2023 12:08 AM] 5298_
I used to think I was a gay man, then I thought I was non-binary, then gender fluid and finally trans then I had a whole separate thing with sexuality


[04/23/2023 12:08 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i still cant grasp non-binary


[04/23/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or neo pronouns


[04/23/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
well i can grasp non binary just not well


[04/23/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
I get it but neo pronouns are still shit


[04/23/2023 12:09 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
neo pronouns shouldnt exist


[04/23/2023 12:09 AM] 5298_
I disagree, I think a majority will be straight but not everyone


[04/23/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
**20.8%** of Gen Z adults in the US identify as LGBT which is an increase from 10.5% in 2017


[04/23/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Younger members of the Gen Z group are more likely to identify as LGBT


[04/23/2023 12:12 AM] 5298_
I think it'll go down but not by too much


[04/23/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think there will be a dramatic drop in the future


[04/23/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ive already seen people saying it was just a phase and shit


[04/23/2023 12:12 AM] 5298_
There's two things happening that's making the numbers rise


[04/23/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
propaganda


[04/23/2023 12:12 AM] 5298_
Kind of


[04/23/2023 12:12 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and sad fuckers on 4 chan trolling people


[04/23/2023 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then people being really gullible and believing them


[04/23/2023 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and then spreading the 4 channers words like wildfire


[04/23/2023 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly how neo pronouns were conceived


[04/23/2023 12:13 AM] 5298_
1. As the world gets more accepting of LGBT people more people are going to feel comfortable coming out 
2. People who are joining a fad


[04/23/2023 12:14 AM] 5298_
Number two will stop, number one won't ( probably )


[04/23/2023 12:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think number one contributes that much tho


[04/23/2023 12:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i honestly think its just number 2


[04/23/2023 12:14 AM] 5298_
It definitely does


[04/23/2023 12:14 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
steering the numbers


[04/23/2023 12:15 AM] 5298_
People are much more likely to come out now then they were in the past


[04/23/2023 12:16 AM] 5298_
Do you know what happened to gay people in the concentration camps after the Americans liberated them. The Americans would line up everyone with pink triangles and shoot them, all of them. This had nothing to do with the Nazis

If you're gay and you hear that are you going to come out? Of course not but if you see that the general public and Parliament are becoming more accepting then you're more likely to come out

English 
( If you go far enough back Africa but that's not a nationality do it doesn't count )

[04/24/2023 8:11 PM] 5298_
Se√†n has a lot of depth, if you actually listen to him instead of getting upset that he's an Irishman with a green hat and ginger hair, he is the father of a rebel and integrated to America ( the mission where you burn down the tobacco fields ). He wasn't received well due to his Irish heritage ( shown by him calling everyone English even when they aren't English showing how much he hates them ) and he was impoverished and stole for a living ( shown from his story of how he met Dutch and Hosea ) since he's one of the youngest of the group and his history with Americans he constantly feels like he needs to improve himself

[04/25/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
A Eulogy to All

Everything will have been.
There will be a time when nothing new will ever happen.
Everything that has ever happened will all melt together into the silent cacophony,
The unblinking pupil.
The mass of everything,
The great mystery.
This will happen. 
And you won‚Äôt exist.
Your history and future will be forgotten, incinerated and lost.
We won‚Äôt be.
The God that rules the heavens and breathes life into all; will destroy us and kill herself in a glory of colour.
The Earth's losses and victories,
Her parasite that rules over her with complete dominion,
That has crafted a history and future for itself,
Will be destroyed with nothing left.
We call this mortality.
The notion that one will die is terrifying for most,
And debilitating for some.
But mortality is not just the notion that one will die,
It is the notion that their kinship will die,
Their friends,
Enemies,
Communities,
Future.
Everything that will ever be will die.
This can be a horrific notion.
Mortality is a sickening word that infects us all.
Some try to cheat it with a legacy, this too is fleeting.
For when the people that know this legacy die, 
And the statues fall,
And the books decay,
So too will that legacy.
A legacy is a mortal man extending his life,
Not negating death,
Just prolonging it until after they rot.
Then everything will rot and none of this will matter.

SKY IS CLEAH


[04/25/2023 12:28 AM] 5298_
She sells sea shells on the sea shore
But the value of these shells will fall
Due to the laws of supply and demand 
No one wants to buy shells when there's loads on the same
Step 1: you must create a sense of scarcity
Shells will sell much better if the people think they're rare you see 
Bare with me 
And take as many shells as you can find
And hide them on an island
Stock pile them high
Until they're rarer than the diamond 
Step 2: you gotta make the people think that they want them
Really want them
Really fucking want them
Hit them like Bronson 
Influencers
Product placement
Featured prime time entertainment
If you haven't got a shell than you're just a fucking waste man
3: it's monopoly
Invest inside some property
Start a corporation
Make a logo do it properly
Shells must sell
That'll be your new philosophy
Swallow all your morals
They're a poor man's quality
4: Expand
Expand
Expand
Clear forest
Make land
Fresh blood
On hand 
5: why just shells
Why limit yourself 
She sells sea shells sell oil as well
6: sell guns
Sell sticks
Sell diamonds
Sell rocks
Sell the water to a fish
Sell the time to a clock
7: press on the gas 
Take your foot off the brake 
Run to be the president of the united states 
8:  big smile mate
Big wave that's great
Now the truth is overrated
Tell lies out the gate 
9: polarize the people
Controversy is the game 
It don't matter if they hate you
If they all say your name
10: the world is yours 
Step out onto the stage to a round of applause
You're a lair
A cheat
A devil
A whore 
And you sell sea shells on the sea shore 

- Your Discords motto

forgot the words obvs but remember the meaning


[04/25/2023 9:05 PM] 5298_
It had a positive message at the end but it was shit and I hate it


[04/25/2023 9:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
positive message had to go


[04/25/2023 9:05 PM] 5298_
ONLY NEGATIVE EMOTIONS


[04/25/2023 9:06 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you cant just tell someone that nothing they do matters because it will eventually be forgotten and eventually they will be forgotten along with their friends family etc then say its ok tho


[04/25/2023 9:07 PM] 5298_
I still have it somewhere I'll send you it


[04/25/2023 9:08 PM] 5298_
So be good.
 
And choose to die or rot first. 

If you respect my opinion, I would rot first, for that could make others happy and for a fleeting world shall happiness not be the victor? For if nothing matters and we will all die why not make the stupid bit first good?

Clearly I'd been watching a bit too much Exurb1a


[04/25/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
As I said, shit


[04/25/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I actually think ive got brain damage


[04/25/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that would explain why my brain doesnt fucking work like it used to


[04/25/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
Same


[04/25/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
all that head smashing fucked me up


[04/25/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe its not that ive gotten more mentally ill but more mentally damaged instead


[04/25/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it takes me ages to figure out shit compared to what i used to be like


[04/25/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe head smashing does do damage after all


[04/25/2023 9:32 PM] 5298_
Maybe


[04/25/2023 9:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if past lives exist i wonder who i was


[04/25/2023 9:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or what i was


[04/25/2023 9:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
couldve been a fucking alien

[04/25/2023 10:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ive got an idea for cultures around those mountains


[04/25/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
since the mountains span the entire continent and are way higher than everest in a lot of places, one of the cultures would believe that beyond the 'wall' is where the homes of the gods is


[04/25/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
crossing the wall was impossible for these cultures


[04/25/2023 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and trying to venture beyond them meant death


[04/25/2023 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe they would believe that beyond the wall is also where the afterlife is, and would explain dying while trying to pass through them


[04/25/2023 10:20 PM] 5298_
Couldn't the people around the shores sail across?


[04/25/2023 10:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they could, im talking around central continent cultures tho


[04/25/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_
Maybe you could make Myths about people who tried and failed so no one else wants to


[04/25/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
actually im talking wall cultures in general


[04/25/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
before boats they thought all that shit listed


[04/25/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and when the first sailors landed there, they were terrified


[04/25/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
also probs wouldnt be human these people but theyre still people


[04/25/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they wouldve thought the people were souls who were rewarded by the gods


[04/25/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they wouldve been surprised that landing there didnt kill them


[04/25/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I FUCKING LOVE THAT WHOLE CULTURE IDEA


[04/25/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
most of the central continent would have been desert/savanna so it wouldve been a death sentence those mountains either way


[04/25/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the planet is a lot warmer than earth so the entire east coast of this first continent is pretty much rainforest


[04/25/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
Do you think it would be a reverse America where they find native people across the wall and worship them as gods instead of, yknow, genocide


[04/25/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[04/25/2023 10:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
absolutely

I think an island that's uncontacted for ages like North Sentinel Island would be cool


[04/25/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there'll be plenty


[04/25/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the people wouldnt be able to take over a lot of the planet quickly like humans did


[04/25/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that could allow 2 intelligent species


[04/25/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
who wouldnt be aware of their existence for millions of years


[04/25/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_
Wouldn't the continents be bigger than Earth's if it's hotter?


[04/25/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its not hotter


[04/25/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its a little older than earth and a little smaller


[04/25/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_
.


[04/25/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not the core


[04/25/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i mean the surface because of the atmosphere


[04/25/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
I know


[04/25/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
The tide would be lower with more rainfall due to higher rates of evaporation wouldn't it?


[04/25/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
no the tide is higher than on earth, and there is more rainfall


[04/25/2023 10:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
tide is to do with the moon


[04/25/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
I mean like water level and shit, I might just be retarded though


[04/25/2023 10:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The water level would be higher because less of it is stored in ice


[04/25/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
Oh yeah


[04/25/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
Silly me


[04/25/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

i wish there was a real way to see past lives if they even exist


[04/25/2023 11:24 PM] 5298_

[04/25/2023 11:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/25/2023 11:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and the future


[04/25/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_
I don't want to see the future


[04/25/2023 11:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I do


[04/25/2023 11:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not for the human race but for the universe


[04/25/2023 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
although i would like to see how society evolves after i die


[04/25/2023 11:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i just wish it was like a video and i could scroll back or forward to the time i want and just observe


[04/25/2023 11:28 PM] 5298_
I want to see the past because I struggle to remember that people from the past ( and everyone else for that matter ) are actual people who have full lives just like me that have nothing to do with me


[04/25/2023 11:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats why i also want to see the past


[04/25/2023 11:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the only real evidence of the past is paintings, and black and white images


[04/25/2023 11:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i want to see the past for what it was and not what it looks like to us now

If I met a genie my three wishes would be the past and ghost thing and to understand every language ever like the TARDIS


[04/25/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If i met a genie my three wishes would be: I could observe the past and future at will, be able to communicate with everything that has and will exist, and I will become all-knowing (this sounds depressing but I want to know about absolutely everything)


[04/25/2023 11:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/27/2023 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes it is


[04/27/2023 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
irish side ends way earlier


[04/27/2023 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
english side goes back to 1500s


[04/27/2023 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
think 1530s


[04/27/2023 9:08 PM] 5298_
Cause we've had census since 1086


[04/27/2023 9:09 PM] 5298_
I'm going to try and get my family tree


[04/27/2023 9:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i just got bored one day and now have hundreds of relatives on it


[04/27/2023 9:10 PM] 5298_
Irish will be hard because of Dublin Fire but I'll use the national archive's site for the domesday book to get all my English relatives


[04/27/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it can be way easier than that


[04/27/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
make the tree on ancestry (just cause it looks nicer and is a tad easier imo) but you can get some free records off findmypast


[04/27/2023 9:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ancestry puts everything behind a paywall tho


[04/27/2023 9:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i got the trial and cancelled it immediately so it doesnt charge but i cant get it again now


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
Can I use the tree without paying but not access the data?


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yes ofc


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what im doing now


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
Will do


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
I've got a new mask


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you need to change mask everyday


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
It's not those paper ones


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
otherwise it causes really bad acne


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
for fabric ones and that just wash them


[04/27/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
I do change it everyday but I've got some fabric ones now


[04/27/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
I have like 10 so I'll wear a new one each day and wash them at the end of the week


[04/27/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wearing masks is gonna make your facial dysmorphia worse cause it fucks skin up


[04/27/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i obviously get acne but i dont think ill get it bad


[04/27/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
genetics says so


[04/27/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
My facial dysmorphias gotten better and I'm a retard so I think if I can't see it I can't hate it


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
fair


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
my paternal family hasd pretty much no acne but maternal family has loads


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
I should probably use anti-acne cream


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so basically i get a bit but not much


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yeah probably


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
apparently it turns your burns green


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
I don't have any burns


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so you can mess with archaeologists in the far future


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
bones


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not burns


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
Oh


[04/27/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
Fluorescent bones


[04/27/2023 9:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I've not used ancestry before, I just signed in and it says 'start with yourself' and has my full name


[04/27/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
did you sign up with a google account?


[04/27/2023 9:33 PM] 5298_

[04/27/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Ancestry still thinks Barrow is in Lancashire


[04/27/2023 9:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its got barrow, lancashire and barrow, cumbria for different time periods for some reason


[04/27/2023 9:41 PM] 5298_

[04/27/2023 9:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
use findmypast for researching shit tho it has a lot of records free


[04/27/2023 9:42 PM] 5298_
Yeah but I think for some parts my Nana will be more reliable, Findmypast gives like 4 different wives and shit


[04/27/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_
It's good but I think my Nana will know who her parents are better than a website


[04/27/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_

[04/27/2023 9:43 PM] 5298_

Why is the suggestion for Dublin, Dublin, Ohio before Dublin, Dublin


[04/27/2023 10:06 PM] 5298_
It was a nickname but my Mary "Myra" Mulvey was born far too early


[04/27/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
Odd


[04/27/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
Timothy's death date is 1979 but I thought that he died just before my dad was born

Probably


[04/28/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i cant wait to have a little money so i can live in ireland


[04/28/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i bet its way fucking nicer than britain


[04/28/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and its economy is exponentially increasing


[04/28/2023 7:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its way richer than britain


[04/28/2023 7:19 PM] 5298_
I want to own a little cottage in the middle of fuckknows Ireland


[04/28/2023 7:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/28/2023 7:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would be nice


[04/28/2023 7:19 PM] 5298_
I like it


[04/28/2023 7:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but also if i needed to get fucking food and shit it would be way harder


[04/28/2023 7:20 PM] 5298_
Yeah


[04/28/2023 7:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and at times it would feel a little bit lonely probably


[04/28/2023 7:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i cant wait to get my own house but i can wait


[04/28/2023 7:20 PM] 5298_
But by the time I'm old enough I bet ASDA drone strike your delivery and robots give you Amazon parcels


[04/28/2023 7:20 PM] 5298_
I'd live with someone


[04/28/2023 7:21 PM] 5298_
I couldn't live on my own, I'd actually go full schitzo

[04/28/2023 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I get anxious when i know im alone but idfk why


[04/28/2023 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like when im home alone normally im fine but sometimes im not


[04/28/2023 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i dont like going into woods and shit by myself cause i feel like im gonna get murdered without a chance to defend myself


[04/28/2023 7:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but also i love the woods cause theyre nice


[04/28/2023 7:22 PM] 5298_
I would tear the house down because I think there's someone in my walls


[04/28/2023 7:23 PM] 5298_
I don't know why but I can only handle being alone when I have music playing


[04/28/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hate silence at times


[04/28/2023 7:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
sometimes its nice but sometimes its horrible


[04/28/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like in school it feels nice and it makes me feel free when i can walk around the quiet corridoors


[04/28/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i overthink too much tho


[04/28/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont go in abandoned places often because i think that everything will go wrong even tho it wont


[04/28/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like ill get trapped or something


[04/28/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think my mum gave me that fear of being trapped


[04/28/2023 7:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its like claustrophobia but not


[04/28/2023 7:26 PM] 5298_
Silence is awful, I like it when it's quiet but not silent and music can be as loud as possible and I'm still good


[04/28/2023 7:27 PM] 5298_
Being physically unable to leave somewhere makes me feel sick


[04/28/2023 7:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im an adventurous person but dont adventure because i feel afraid when im alone since im clearly weak and unable to defend myself


[04/28/2023 7:29 PM] 5298_

[04/28/2023 8:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

i got fine personal hygiene


[04/28/2023 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i show emotion


[04/28/2023 9:18 PM] 5298_
Sounds like schizophrenia or psychosis


[04/28/2023 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i sleep a lot when theres no school but when there is school get like 5 hours of sleep


[04/28/2023 9:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/28/2023 9:19 PM] 5298_
Yeah


[04/28/2023 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
a lot of these seem to go hand in hand with whatever i have


[04/28/2023 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
obviously not been diagnosed but im under an assumption that its probably autism adhd or both


[04/28/2023 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

theyre called hypnagogic hallucinations


[04/28/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think


[04/28/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like that time i could see through my eyelids and that but it looked like the world was 3 different image layers splitting apart


[04/28/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or when it feels like im leaving my body


[04/28/2023 9:23 PM] 5298_

Save for the two in the overlap


[04/28/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive been getting reality confusion, maybe hallucinations and maybe paranoid thought patterns, not pyschosis and those have appeared in adolescence


[04/28/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
normally adhd gets easier as you age but its getting harder for me to cope with anything


[04/28/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
especially as of recently


[04/28/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/28/2023 9:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Potentially


[04/28/2023 9:50 PM] 5298_

[04/28/2023 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nobody ever messages me apart from cole and that


[04/28/2023 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it feels like nobody wants to talk to me


[04/28/2023 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i feel like im annoying people just by existing


[04/28/2023 9:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats why i dont want to talk to people anymore


[04/28/2023 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/28/2023 9:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its an i know


[04/28/2023 9:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i should either try as use that as motivation or just stop speaking to people until i can be fixed


[04/28/2023 10:00 PM] 5298_
You don't need fixing, you have your difficulties but just because that's all people see doesn't mean that's all you are


[04/28/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel dread whenever someone speaks to me because i cant hold a conversation and everyone thinks im a loonie lmfao


[04/28/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and you know what maybe i am


[04/28/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i need to try use that as motivation to just get on with my life


[04/28/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

What program were you using?


[04/28/2023 10:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cracked fl studio on a virtual machine


[04/28/2023 10:09 PM] 5298_
The virtual machine isn't the thing that got you doxxed by the Ukrainians was it


[04/28/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/28/2023 10:10 PM] 5298_

[04/28/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/28/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/28/2023 10:10 PM] 5298_
Yeah well I'm retarded


[04/28/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
I thought of an awesome edit when I left school today about John so I'm going to try and make that


[04/28/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
Do you have any songs you'd recommend


[04/28/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
It's going to be a bit like that Micah one so a song similar to that would help


[04/28/2023 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont have any edit songs like that


[04/28/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
I swear to God John screams his name in American Venom but I can't find the clip


[04/28/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i swear he does too


[04/28/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
He does


[04/28/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
He shouts "It's John Marston, Micah"

I'm using Jim Milton rides again because it's fitting and it's a great song


[04/28/2023 11:12 PM] 5298_
I like that American Venom and Jim Milton Rides Again have a similar tune


[04/28/2023 11:22 PM] 5298_
This is confusing me


[04/28/2023 11:22 PM] 5298_
I want to use that audio from the first video but it won't work because of the music


[04/28/2023 11:22 PM] 5298_

[04/28/2023 11:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I'm going to find the most famous media about the IRA and turn it into propaganda and display it in my room


[04/30/2023 7:07 PM] 5298_
There's a fire engine outside


[04/30/2023 7:07 PM] 5298_

[04/30/2023 7:14 PM] 5298_
You see, it's a joke about me ( May Mulvey ) owning a bomb ( which is something I might have considering I am in support of the IRA ( Irish Republican Army ) and am in possession of numerous illegal documents ) and that the fire brigade were outside to take care of they hypothetical bomb I might be in possession of


[04/30/2023 7:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/30/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[04/30/2023 7:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[05/01/2023 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think theyre pretty normal but everyone seems to disagree


[05/01/2023 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when im drifting off and im half sleeping half awake i start hallucinating shit


[05/01/2023 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like my thoughts turn into weird dreams


[05/01/2023 1:15 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and that


[05/01/2023 1:16 AM] 5298_
I think I have that


[05/01/2023 1:16 AM] 5298_
It's not like hallucinations it's just my daydreams get fucking weird and more like actual dreams


[05/01/2023 1:16 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly


[05/01/2023 1:16 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what they are


[05/01/2023 1:17 AM] 5298_
It's like an in-between state of being fully awake and REM sleep


[05/01/2023 1:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
once i was thinking of that war thing between barrow and millom then it turned into me walking through kells with matthew kendall and suddenly two people in boxes were throwing punches at each other


[05/01/2023 1:17 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had lucid hypagonic hallucinations once


[05/01/2023 1:17 AM] 5298_
Where I have the self-awarness I have normally but in the fucking fever dream coke fest's REM sleep are


[05/01/2023 1:18 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i got bored and decided to just lie there for like 30 mins and i ended up in a lucid hallucination where i can close my eyes and immediately go back into the world and return to the real world whenever


[05/01/2023 1:18 AM] 5298_
I can do that after I wake up


[05/01/2023 1:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i can go back into the dream after i wake up but normally its not lucid


[05/01/2023 1:19 AM] 5298_
If I had a vivid dream I can just go back into it but it's a hypagonic hallucination instead of a dream


[05/01/2023 1:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lucid dreams are funny


[05/01/2023 1:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
in one of them i killed lewis harrison for some reason


[05/01/2023 1:19 AM] 5298_
GOOD


[05/01/2023 1:19 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like he was in my dream talking to me then i went lucid and just slashed him into pieces


[05/01/2023 1:20 AM] 5298_
The other night before I went to sleep I had a hallucination I beat Lexi to death


[05/01/2023 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao


[05/01/2023 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
that one hallucination where i could see through my eyelids tho


[05/01/2023 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[05/01/2023 1:20 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i know they werent open


[05/01/2023 1:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i was watching the video through my eye lids then the world looked like it split into 3 rgb layers or something


[05/01/2023 1:21 AM] 5298_
I broke her nose and half her teeth fell out and I was drenched in her blood


[05/01/2023 1:21 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

but it looked like barrow if it was irish for some reason and it wasnt derry


[05/01/2023 1:24 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but the waterloo had that derry logo thing that the ira painted on the wall


[05/01/2023 1:27 AM] 5298_
I had a hallucination where I was a part of the IRA and four of us were tasked with killing the King so two went off and planted bombs outside the palace and me and the other guy went on a roof across from the palace with a sniper and aimed through a window at the kind and when the other guy screamed Tiocfaidh √°r l√° the two guys set off the bombs so obviously all the guards ran over to take control of the situation ( like 30 people had been fucking atomised or had their limps strewn across Queen Victoria's statue ) and I blew the kinds head of, it fucking blew up like Se√†ns

[05/01/2023 11:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ik loads of people try to make games about it and usually theyre shit but theres always good ones


[05/01/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
me lucus and cole love this backrooms map on rec room and we replayed it


[05/01/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
I remember watching a video about the backrooms in 2020 when it was like one story


[05/01/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
I love that story and I love what it was back then


[05/01/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i love the simple idea of the levels and shit


[05/01/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont like the complicated quantum lore and shit


[05/01/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
The modern backrooms actually kinda pisses me off, some of them do it really well but some don't


[05/01/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly


[05/01/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
most of the level ideas are fucking awesome but the lore is a bit shit


[05/01/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The idea of the backrooms is a good one


[05/01/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_
The original concept was that there were these spaces that when no one was looking you could clip out of reality and you'd be sent into this liminal office then you'd have to either 
A) make it through the levels hoping to reach the bottom ( although no one had ever done it and it might be infinite )
B) find a space in the backrooms to clip back out
Each level was completely unique and had a unique entity that would stalk the level, only some of them were hostile, most were violent though but some where only violent when confronted


[05/01/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_
The lore used to be great


[05/01/2023 11:18 PM] 5298_
You know that guy Wendigoon made a video on about the Backrooms


[05/01/2023 11:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think ive seen it


[05/01/2023 11:18 PM] 5298_
I hate him


[05/01/2023 11:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[05/01/2023 11:22 PM] 5298_
Because he turned a brilliant idea about dimensions and unfortunate people into a malicious thing about governments and organisations and malice everywhere when that's not what it was at all


[05/01/2023 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No i think that was the natural course of progression


[05/01/2023 11:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was always gonna end up like that but everyone knows what the main idea is


[05/01/2023 11:23 PM] 5298_
It makes sense why it happened but I still don't like it


[05/01/2023 11:25 PM] 5298_

Wee German Lairdie - Scottish Jacobite Song (Lyrics)
"Wee German Lairdie" is a Scottish Jacobite Song mocking the German king George I and his hobby of gardening. Jacobitism was a political movement that supported the restoration of the legitimate house of Stuart to the throne.

@NASAExoplanets Is this simulation a cross-section? The event horizon should be a sphere, not a circle. So we should be seeing light between us and the singularity instead of seeing a black void. 

Or am I totally off-base?

I feel like an abused dog at the shelter. Flinching at any sound or person. Hiding in the corner with my head down, I don't bare my teeth for it gets me kicked, I don't speak for it me shouted at, I don't perform tricks for it gets me laughed at. I just cower and wait for the day they'll put me down

I've always been told that I'm destined for greatness, that if I try I can learn anything. Now I can't try without wanting to kill myself and I've come to realise I know nothing


[05/02/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
I'm not smart


[05/02/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
I'm a liar and a con, I just speak as if I know what I'm on about, but when I speak with people who actually know things and are smart I'm shown for what I truly am; a liar and a fucking idiot


[05/02/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
I have nothing now, my entire future was dependent on me being smart but I'm not and now I have fuck all


[05/02/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
I have shit writings that laugh at the mastery of language that is litterateur, I have faux morals

I need therapy but I'm terrified to ask

I know I have problems but I can't really define them without sounding fucking insane


[05/02/2023 11:12 PM] 5298_

[05/03/2023 6:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
what is the whole entire full anecdote


[05/03/2023 6:09 PM] 5298_
I didn't go to science as you could probably guess. I went to our usual room to find it empty them checked all the Kells computer rooms so I went to the hub then found out where you were. When I went over there I saw it was the feckless retard ""teaching"" so I left and sat in that area in-between Kells and Revaulx and read. This year 8 - who had previously tried to steal my lunch from me last year and I had to chase him down all of Kells to get it back - walked up to me and asked why I was wearing my mask, stating that covid ended ages ago. Then he asked what my book mark was at the back of book and tried to grab so I swatted his hand. His friend ""whispered"" in his ear " grab it, just grab it off him" so he did and I chased him down and he ran into that alcove outside Mr. O'Donnells room and the Hub and I beat the shit out of him, he fell to the floor and I was about to kick his head in when Mr. O'Donnell came out and shouted at the boys. I went back to reading and Mr. O'Donnell came over and asked if I'm alright, said he'd shouted at the boys


[05/03/2023 6:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Who was it what did they look like


[05/03/2023 6:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Dont know how to describe him  but hes got brown eyes brown hair


[05/03/2023 6:12 PM] 5298_
Yeah, squarish face, dark brown hair cut like how most people have it minus the weird flick, don't know his eye colour though


[05/03/2023 6:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Might be then


[05/03/2023 6:13 PM] 5298_
He's not a particularly stand out fella but I could pick him out in a small crowd

actually probs more but thats who im thinking of

i cant believe people actually think that the french accent is hot


[05/03/2023 6:16 PM] 5298_
Irish was voted the sexist accent one year


[05/03/2023 6:16 PM] 5298_
Don't know how


[05/03/2023 6:16 PM] 5298_
The many different Irish accents are nice but they're far from sexy


[05/03/2023 6:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was watching an irish news video on youtube once but didnt realise it was irish at first because the woman sounded american but i listened closer and realised she was irish

[05/03/2023 6:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the only reason for black history month pride month etc is just for corporate entities to make as much money from people as possible


[05/03/2023 6:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they dont care about those groups of people they simply see it as a way to make money


[05/03/2023 6:51 PM] 5298_
Kinda


[05/03/2023 6:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It's not kinda


[05/03/2023 6:52 PM] 5298_
That's the only reason they promote it


[05/03/2023 6:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Racism still exists as widely as it does because the government makes money off a racial divide


[05/03/2023 6:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same with homophobia and all that


[05/03/2023 6:53 PM] 5298_
The only reason businesses give a shit is money, but they exist, in the best cases, to ensure that we never go back to our old ways ( similar reason we always teach WWII ) and in most cases it's just so the government can point to it as say "look, we care. Who gives a shit about your rights, you have a month!"


[05/03/2023 6:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Businesses don't care about the people though


[05/03/2023 6:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They see everyone as money


[05/03/2023 6:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They will exploit the exploitable


[05/03/2023 6:54 PM] 5298_
I think ultimately they do more good than harm


[05/03/2023 6:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Gen Z being gullible as it is is very fucking easy to exploit


[05/03/2023 6:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its still not equal tho


[05/03/2023 6:55 PM] 5298_
I doubt it ever will be equal


[05/03/2023 6:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Even if you think its doing more good than harm its still promoting inequality


[05/03/2023 6:55 PM] 5298_
For some reason, being prejudiced is hardwired into us


[05/03/2023 6:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we never truly will be equal but inequality is still so wide spread and rampant because without it theres no money to gain


[05/03/2023 6:55 PM] 5298_
I don't want equality


[05/03/2023 6:55 PM] 5298_
I think equality is shit


[05/03/2023 6:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats a bit retarded


[05/03/2023 6:56 PM] 5298_
Equity is what we need


[05/03/2023 6:56 PM] 5298_
From each according to their ability
To each according to their need


[05/03/2023 6:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That's what I meant, but I list them both as equality for some reason

[05/03/2023 6:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It should be equity and also equality on an individual level and not where everyone is clumped together into groups


[05/03/2023 6:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That would be hard to achieve but if without the corruption of the government it would be so much easier


[05/03/2023 6:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there never will be a society with no corruption


[05/03/2023 7:00 PM] 5298_
True equity on an individual level would be very hard to do that's why they clump people together, if you have 67 million people, like 6 groups is far easier to handle


[05/03/2023 7:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe if people stopped blinding following everything they hear then we might be getting somewhere


[05/03/2023 7:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Everyone is brainwashed into either being radical racists or other radical racists


[05/03/2023 7:01 PM] 5298_
Inequality is hardwired into us


[05/03/2023 7:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Hardwired into us because the government hardwires it into us


[05/03/2023 7:01 PM] 5298_
It's not a coincidence that for as long as people have lived there have been social classes


[05/03/2023 7:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fair


[05/03/2023 7:03 PM] 5298_
The first evidence of slavery is in fucking 1754 BCE


[05/03/2023 7:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It is hardwired into us


[05/03/2023 7:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But all the information fed to us within our lives just makes that hardwiring even harder


[05/03/2023 7:04 PM] 5298_
3100 BCE is the earliest evidence of patriarchy


[05/03/2023 7:05 PM] 5298_
I think it's an animalistic instinct mixed with our intellect


[05/03/2023 7:05 PM] 5298_
There are two things hardwired into every single living organism on the fucking planet


[05/03/2023 7:05 PM] 5298_
Stay alive
Have kids


[05/03/2023 7:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The government exploits the slight divide that already exists among us and balloons the size of that natural divide hundredfold


[05/03/2023 7:06 PM] 5298_
It's much easier to get food, water and a mate if half the people in your society are seen as dirty and lesser and you're dirty and lesser for interacting with them


[05/03/2023 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If you have never seen a black person before obviously you would be weirded out when seeing one. Same goes for every other race. But somehow in our multi-ethnic and diverse society, racism seems to be on the rise despite the multiple friendly interactions you will face everyday with other ethnic groups.


[05/03/2023 7:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Point is there is no point to life and you will one day die


[05/03/2023 7:08 PM] 5298_
If you hold a large number of your population in bondage you can get all the resources and no potential mate is going to want to be a part of the "other" and they'll mate with you


[05/03/2023 7:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and even if you think that reproducing is a point to life it is not


[05/03/2023 7:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because eventually all species go extinct


[05/03/2023 7:09 PM] 5298_
I think we can overcome it by embracing it in a sense


[05/03/2023 7:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we can overcome it by instating me as prime minister


[05/03/2023 7:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or destroying parliament


[05/03/2023 7:10 PM] 5298_
We kinda have to create a paradox, make the "other" the bigots


[05/03/2023 7:10 PM] 5298_
Then no one is going to want to be a bigot

[05/03/2023 7:14 PM] 5298_
Africa is too hot, Oceania is too far away and I also just don't like the idea of living in the southern hemisphere so that also rules out South America, I also don't want to be there because I like keeping my head on my neck, Asia is too racist and Eastern Europe is a bit shit. They were shafted by the USSR and leaving it and wouldn't like to go


[05/03/2023 7:15 PM] 5298_
I'd either live in England ( God forbid ) a Celtic country, Scandinavia or the US, maybe Canada


[05/03/2023 7:16 PM] 5298_
I also don't quite fancy the Mediterranean


[05/03/2023 7:17 PM] 5298_
I don't find Spain appealing, I have a genuine repulsion for Italy, Greece is alright but I don't want to worry about waking up and having all my money mean fuck all, and the rest of the Mediterranean is either Eastern Europe or Turkey and I don't fancy Turkey; too many Earth quakes and they don't know where they fucking are

[05/03/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
probably because i tried to make everything seem new

I've probably made this up but it's an infinitely long beach with a pier, and every hundred or so miles apart there is another identical pier but you can't access it. There's no way off the beach ( save for the sea but that's just infinite water which isn't very fun ) and you kind of just have to walk for God knows how long until you noclip again either out or to a new level. I'm pretty sure the longest someone walked was like 7 centuries and the shortest was 4ish years


[05/04/2023 9:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe


[05/04/2023 9:24 PM] 5298_

'A lynching is the public killing of an individual who has not received any due process. These executions were often carried out by lawless mobs, though police officers did participate, under the pretext of justice.'

You're killing ants like it's a Mexican cartel and you've seen more gore than a WWII soldier in the Eastern Front

It just reminds me of something but I'm not sure what


[05/04/2023 10:40 PM] 5298_
There's something in the back of my mind telling me I've been there before


[05/04/2023 10:41 PM] 5298_
Over the summer holidays we could go around an empty school


[05/04/2023 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[05/04/2023 10:41 PM] 5298_

I've done it before but there was a groundskeeper there so I had to run for my fucking life


[05/04/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_

[05/04/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
I was just wandering around the yard and saw someone walk out the building and I fucking turned high tale and ran


[05/04/2023 10:43 PM] 5298_
Most of the time


[05/04/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
Layla's the one that showed me how to get in but she left and I stayed


[05/04/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
In the middle of summer there probably won't be many people there


[05/04/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
There might be some druggies


[05/04/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
They use Witches Finger to get high out their minds without being found out


[05/04/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
Kids don't go round there because they think they'll get hunted by a witch and adults have no reason to go down there


[05/04/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
im scared of getting caught doing shit because i dont want to get my mum into trouble or for her to see me as bad


[05/04/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats why i dont do stuff often


[05/04/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but i dont think she cares that much


[05/04/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_

[05/04/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
I'm quick and have good eyes and ears so I trust myself to not get caught


[05/04/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
Unless I'm on someone's roof


[05/04/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
In that case I get to have a conversation with a very angry police officer


[05/04/2023 10:49 PM] 5298_
And get shouted at by a very angry old woman


[05/04/2023 10:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I can run away but not got much stamina and also normally i run somewhere then realise ive split off from the rest of them


[05/04/2023 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the police tried to ambush us once but one of our mates told us that they were waiting round a corner so we ran through the middle of the allotment thingy path over walney then hid because there were police all over


[05/04/2023 10:50 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[05/04/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
The first time I was running from some guy who said he was going to rape me and it turns out that wasn't a path but instead a load of nettles, I had to jump from tree to tree like fucking Tarzan. The second time was at Jay's house when I climbed a tree and nearly fell down into a bunch of nettles and then a stream


[05/04/2023 11:02 PM] 5298_

[05/07/2023 1:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
only good french food is croissants


[05/07/2023 1:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and even then its debatable


[05/07/2023 1:37 AM] 5298_
True


[05/07/2023 1:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
croissants boring as fuck


[05/07/2023 1:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
either that or snails and frogs


[05/07/2023 1:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
only french cuisine


[05/07/2023 1:37 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and shitting ratatouile which looks like aids if it was a food


[05/07/2023 1:37 AM] 5298_
Croissants only good if you cut them in half and spread like Nutella or something on it

cant believe they think yorkshire should be its own country


[05/07/2023 1:39 AM] 5298_
She's used to make whales feel better about themselves


[05/07/2023 1:39 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
yorkshire is the most english county in the north


[05/07/2023 1:39 AM] 5298_

its literally just desert mountains


[05/07/2023 1:41 AM] 5298_
Most of the middle East and North Africa shouldn't be inhabited


[05/07/2023 1:41 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
exactly


[05/07/2023 1:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we should stop sending aid to them because deserts shouldnt have villages and shit


[05/07/2023 1:42 AM] 5298_
Only the coasts and along major rivers like the Nile


[05/07/2023 1:42 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and they shouldnt be surprised that theyre starving


[05/07/2023 1:43 AM] 5298_
I don't know why we feel the need to have every bit of land owned by someone


[05/07/2023 1:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
african nations are all so poor and shit because all their governments are corrupt


[05/07/2023 1:43 AM] 5298_
The needs to be a country everywhere


[05/07/2023 1:43 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
we send billions every year in aid to africa and by now it should be like a utopia


[05/07/2023 1:44 AM] 5298_
Hard to build a utopia when you can't grow shit and it's geographically impossible to get water


[05/07/2023 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then maybe all the people should migrate down to the sub saharan nations


[05/07/2023 1:44 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
instead of living in the middle of a desert

stop funding the saharan nations and let natural selection do its due course


[05/07/2023 1:45 AM] 5298_
They should do what Australia does


[05/07/2023 1:46 AM] 5298_
No one lives anywhere near the deserts

if they get glorified so should syria iraq and afghanistan but nobody gives a shit about them


[05/10/2023 8:52 PM] 5298_
Because it was us and the Yanks that invaded them and the evil commie Russians that invaded Ukraine


[05/10/2023 8:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[05/10/2023 8:52 PM] 5298_

[05/10/2023 11:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im so tired


[05/10/2023 11:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I used to stay up till like 5am and id be high from how tired i was


[05/10/2023 11:22 PM] 5298_

I want to do that more over summer and try to write something in that state


[05/10/2023 11:22 PM] 5298_
It'd be cool to read it when I'm normal again


[05/10/2023 11:29 PM] 5298_
I'm never having drugs because that will kill me because of my asthma and other issues so if I ever do anything it will be alcohol


[05/10/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
I kind of hope I do shit on the science test


[05/10/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
If I do well or even okay that will be an ego boost I don't need

[05/11/2023 10:18 PM] 5298_
It's the smoke that's harmful not the weed, so brownies ( when you take the correct amount ) are pretty much completely fine, not great for you and can fuck your brain up a little but not much when you're developing but what's one more mental disorder


[05/11/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fair


[05/11/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
I already have suspected autism, schizophrenia, brain damage and psychosis


[05/11/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_
Basically, you could hurl a new born baby at a brick wall and it would be more sound of mind then I am


[05/11/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmao


[05/11/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_
I'm already feeling out of it


[05/11/2023 10:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think my brain is more fucked up than it should be because during school days and normally saturday im very sleep deprived


[05/11/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
even if i go to sleep on friday and get enough sleep the sleep deprivation still doesnt go away


[05/11/2023 10:22 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so im much worse than i could be because my sleeps schedules fucked


[05/11/2023 10:23 PM] 5298_
With me I either get not enough sleep so I try to make it up and end up getting too much


[05/11/2023 10:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes same


[05/11/2023 10:24 PM] 5298_
I think I'd do edibles if I was with certain friends

[05/11/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im scared that if i got stoned tho my parents would know and freak out


[05/11/2023 10:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
one time i got a tiny tiny bit stoned from second hand smoke and my stepdad knew then and asked me if ive been doing drugs so i said no


[05/11/2023 10:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
couldnt tell if it was joke or coincidence


[05/11/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
You because I don't have to be worried about embarrassing myself and saying something stupid because I'm very open with you and Chloe because she gets high loads so she'd understand if I did some dumb shit

today


[05/11/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I had to kill myself in my dream last night


[05/11/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_
Cheery


[05/11/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was at some weird castle with my dad and that that was surrounded by semi-distant castles then all of a sudden these people started swarming our castle and then we killed them or scared them off i dont remember


[05/11/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Then they came back and chased me with some blade so i ran to my dads house and locked myself in


[05/11/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but then they got in so i hid in a room


[05/11/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and they got into that too so i kept jebaiting them and doing loop


[05/11/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
loops around the house


[05/11/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then all of a sudden they were at the bottom of some stairs and i went lucid


[05/11/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the first thing that came to mind was that i had to kill myself


[05/11/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
because if i didnt then he would stab me and since it was a dream id feel the pain


[05/11/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
Me at any minor inconvenience


[05/11/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i jumped over the landing head first while he stared at me and the bottom of the stairs and closed my eyes


[05/11/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
felt the air rush past then crack and silence


[05/11/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then woke up


[05/11/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
very silly thing


[05/11/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ja


[05/11/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
I threw myself down the stairs in a dream once


[05/11/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Isla said whenever she tries to speak to you you storm off which i dont think is true but ja


[05/11/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[05/11/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
No


[05/11/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
She always pesters me


[05/11/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What does she pester you about


[05/11/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
She just keeps asking me questions


[05/11/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fair she does that to everyone


[05/11/2023 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The only thing that i hear people say to you is that you need to wash your hair but im pretty sure you do since you told me you shower then about your mask and people wonder why youre so quiet


[05/11/2023 10:41 PM] 5298_
I do wash my hair, I washed it today


[05/11/2023 10:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[05/11/2023 10:41 PM] 5298_
I'm just not really sure if there's something I need to do now it's long because no one ever told me


[05/11/2023 10:42 PM] 5298_
When I was really little my dad taught me how to wash my hair and my mum taught Danielle so I don't really know what to do so I just do what I always do


[05/11/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I shower every morning


[05/11/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I prefer it to night


[05/11/2023 10:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cause when i shower at night in the morning im dead greasy


[05/11/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and i sweat way too much so i smell


[05/11/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats why morning shower better


[05/11/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Sometimes get a night shower too but thats only if ive been sweating loads or im freezing cold


[05/11/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or gotten dirty


[05/11/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[05/13/2023 3:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But the mcneills were from barra island in the outer hebrides and moved to ulster


[05/13/2023 3:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or the clan was at least


[05/13/2023 3:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so i dont get how the names are related


[05/13/2023 3:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh the mcneill names and o'neill names are related


[05/13/2023 3:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
As a surname, Neil is traced back to Niall of the Nine Hostages who was an Irish king and eponymous ancestor of the U√≠ N√©ill and MacNeil kindred.


[05/13/2023 3:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So basically in both contexts the name basically mean the same thing


[05/13/2023 3:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And it stills makes sense that i would be an o'neill since mc is son of and o' basically means grandchild of


[05/13/2023 3:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[05/13/2023 10:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She probs meant full name


[05/13/2023 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I gave her my granddads name but not my dads name because unless she goes snooping around facebook and shit and manages to find them then i doubt she will find my dads name lmao


[05/13/2023 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
british birth records only show mothers maiden name


[05/13/2023 11:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so she could find my nana but definitely not my dad


[05/13/2023 11:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[05/13/2023 11:37 PM] 5298_

Because games are getting better visual engines and the world is getting more minimalist there will probably be a time where games look more realistic than life


[05/14/2023 4:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nature isnt gonna get more minimalist


[05/14/2023 4:55 PM] 5298_
No but we're getting rid of nature and building more minimalist


[05/14/2023 4:56 PM] 5298_
Less nature, more minimalist buildings


[05/14/2023 4:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
ok?


[05/14/2023 4:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The buildings are still real tho and climate change shit is making people destroy nature a little less

Some asked him if he loved Jews and his response was "If we were allowed to discuss IQ differences between populations, there'd be fewer conspiracy theories". The average Swedish IQ is 65, the average Jewish IQ is 112


[05/14/2023 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Good notch


[05/14/2023 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Where are you getting this swedish average iq value


[05/14/2023 9:02 PM] 5298_
Well jokes on him because his 1.3 billion dollars is controlled by the Jewish banks

All of the estimates im seeing place it in the high 90s to low 100s


[05/14/2023 9:03 PM] 5298_
It might be population


[05/14/2023 9:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its average iq


[05/14/2023 9:03 PM] 5298_
Nevermind


[05/14/2023 9:03 PM] 5298_
There's more Jews


[05/14/2023 9:03 PM] 5298_
Exactly, more people would probably make it lower

What is the mythos agayun


[05/14/2023 9:55 PM] 5298_
Not really sure but I want it to be a blend of British myths and Greek stories


[05/14/2023 9:55 PM] 5298_
A lot of Greek myths explain things about the world and British myths are just cool stories to tell


[05/14/2023 9:56 PM] 5298_
They explain some things but most are just stories


[05/14/2023 10:21 PM] 5298_

The Case system

Do you think intragalactic travel would be easier or harder there?


[05/14/2023 11:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probably harder

galaxy with little dark matter


[05/14/2023 11:54 PM] 5298_
I would say easier, if you want to go somewhere on the opposite end of the galaxy you need to just wait until you align ( if you can fly across the galaxy I'm guessing you can live for a while or stay in some form of stasis )


[05/14/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same could be said for all galaxies


[05/14/2023 11:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I really hope in my life that some sort of faster than light travel comes around

i doubt it will but i hope

Do we?


[05/15/2023 12:00 AM] 5298_
As far as we know the speed of light is the fastest anything can go


[05/15/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
SHUT THE FUCK UP


[05/15/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO HEAR


[05/15/2023 12:01 AM] 5298_
Speed of light travel would still be fucking mental


[05/15/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats the fastest speed observed but in theory ftl travel is very possible


[05/15/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Faster than light travel is the only reason im alive


[05/15/2023 12:01 AM] 5298_
Ftl travel would be time travel would it not?


[05/15/2023 12:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to be one of the first to be on a faster than light travel


[05/15/2023 12:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probably

It would be both

Man i hope i can explore the universe when i die


[05/15/2023 12:03 AM] 5298_
If we get faster than light travel we could discover the beginning of the universe


[05/15/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I hope it aint nothing just cause the universe has so much to show us and we dont get to see any of it


[05/15/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probably not


[05/15/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
People on earth would experience time faster than what you do but that doesnt mean you go into the past


[05/15/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it just means that time would affect you differently


[05/15/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont think the universe will die a heat death


[05/15/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
Surely there's a limit you can exceed to go back in time


[05/15/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You could experience the death of the universe but never the beginning


[05/15/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And if the death of the universe is the big crunch well then welp


[05/15/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you might be a little stuck


[05/15/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
If time is an actual thing and not something we made up then it has to have a limit


[05/15/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If the death of the universe is this big crunch and it bounces back because it wouldnt just stop existing then yes you would


[05/15/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but then youre stuck at the beginning of the universe in a very hot chemical soup


[05/15/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it would be very boring for millions of years


[05/15/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so then just start travelling again


[05/15/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and get back to modern times


[05/15/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
HOLY SHIT


[05/15/2023 12:06 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I CAN EXPERIENCE PRIME FORTNITE AGAIN IF I MANAGE TO DO THAT


[05/15/2023 12:06 AM] 5298_

[05/15/2023 12:10 AM] 5298_
I think they'll come over soon


[05/15/2023 12:11 AM] 5298_
We've sent them ships, all they have to do is recreate them


[05/15/2023 12:11 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theyll come over kill some people then get wiped out


[05/15/2023 12:11 AM] 5298_

No it wouldnt


[05/15/2023 9:24 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Tell me how


[05/15/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
Their empire made most of Europe the same version of Roman idealism, without Roman conquest there would be a rich and diverse pagan history and Celtic history, Christianity wouldn't be the major European nation


[05/15/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
We would be much further behind technologically tho


[05/15/2023 9:27 PM] 5298_

[05/15/2023 9:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes it is

[05/15/2023 9:32 PM] 5298_
We're becoming diluted by retards that think to be white is to hold the whip and to be a majority is to be the oppressor, those people see culture and try to destroy it as to appease everyone but appease no one


[05/15/2023 9:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
AGREED


[05/15/2023 9:34 PM] 5298_
Just look at religion, I have my own grievance with religion but look at the people who condemn anyone for believing in a deity, people call people of faith stupid for believing what they believe


[05/15/2023 9:35 PM] 5298_
It's so stupid, if you have an opinion you're wrong so slowly we're transforming into a world where everyone will be the same shade of gray and can't talk about their beliefs for fear of being shouted at, people won't be allowed to have culture because it's ''"offensive""

If empires didn't exist we would live in such a diverse world


[05/15/2023 9:39 PM] 5298_

They are but they're still disgusting


[05/15/2023 9:40 PM] 5298_
If I do have kids I think I would want to pass those stories down


[05/15/2023 9:41 PM] 5298_

It was that fake blood bath, then a few months later the girl who turned her thighs to mincemeat, then a few months after that the guy who had his leg blown off and a few weeks later this

Lots of northumbrian genes here with a few west yorkshire genes in furness


[05/16/2023 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Northern irish/southern scottish genes and cumbria genes in cumberland


[05/16/2023 9:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
So basically everyone in cumberland is genetically celtic


[05/16/2023 9:01 PM] 5298_
We have Northumbria, W. Yorkshire and Devon


[05/16/2023 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the cumbrian celtic culture may be gone but the genes sure as fuck arent


[05/16/2023 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That makes a lot of sense too


[05/16/2023 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lots of cornish people came up to barrow for job opportunities and in a way affected the dialect here (i think)


[05/16/2023 9:01 PM] 5298_
Do you think the influx of W. Yorkshire will have anything to do with the closing of the mines?


[05/16/2023 9:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probably


[05/16/2023 9:02 PM] 5298_

A german england is better than an english england


[05/16/2023 10:26 PM] 5298_
Then the one before that was Battle of Hastings


[05/16/2023 10:27 PM] 5298_
We had Battle of Hastings in 1066 and no invading force stepped foot here for over 700 years


[05/16/2023 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Fishguard was 1797


[05/16/2023 10:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The piel invasion was 1487


[05/16/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was the yorkists


[05/16/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
Does that count as a land invasion?


[05/16/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probably


[05/16/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was the yorkists backed by germans and shit


[05/16/2023 10:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The whole army was swabian and swiss


[05/16/2023 10:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

UP THE RA


[05/16/2023 10:31 PM] 5298_
It was a part of the Civil War so it doesn't count as a foreign land invasion


[05/16/2023 10:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fair enough


[05/16/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the civil war made no sense


[05/16/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_
So it was a 700 year gap


[05/16/2023 10:32 PM] 5298_

[05/16/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

It's quite impressive that Germany didn't win WWII


[05/16/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

if churchill wasnt pm german wouldve won


[05/16/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_

1940-41


[05/16/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
Russians hadn't defected, Italians hadn't defected, Yanks hadn't joined, France had fallen, everyone else was neutral pretty much


[05/16/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
Oh and Sweden and Finland had fallen


[05/16/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
I think


[05/16/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
I can't remember


[05/16/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
I just know they weren't helping, they either fell or allied


[05/16/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
Baltics didn't either


[05/16/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Sweden was neutral and finland didnt fall to anyone until barborossa went to shit


[05/16/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
barbarossa


[05/16/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
finland was with the nazis anyway


[05/16/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_
Why'd I say Sweden


[05/16/2023 10:37 PM] 5298_
I meant Finland

It's quite impressive we didn't fall


[05/16/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If another pm was picked the uk would have surrended then the germans wouldve blasted through the soviets


[05/16/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they got only a few miles from moscow even in this timeline


[05/16/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
It also helped that Hitler was a massive retard


[05/16/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so in that timeline moscow would be long gone


[05/16/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Moscow would be moskau


[05/16/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Stalingrad would be fucking Hitlerberg


[05/16/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
Do you think if Hitler hadn't been so badly abused but still started WWII if he would have been smarter and won?


[05/16/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think he was pretty smart in terms of manipulation


[05/16/2023 10:40 PM] 5298_
He was a genius when it came to swaying public opinion and public speaking but as a general he was very silly


[05/16/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[05/16/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

The Producers (1968) - Springtime for Hitler
Wonderful scene from the original version of The Producers (1968). Mel Brooks created one of the gems of American cinema and this is probably the best scene in the movie, the opening of the brand new musical - Springtime for Hitler. Enjoy :)

[05/17/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
I'm debating it but right now I'm thinking no


[05/17/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
I'd probably have to pay and I ain't paying for that shit and I'd be terrified my family would tell immediately

[05/17/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_

[05/17/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[05/17/2023 11:03 PM] 5298_

[05/17/2023 11:04 PM] 5298_

[05/18/2023 6:07 PM] 5298_
By the time you're out that child would still probably be underage üíÄ


[05/18/2023 6:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What


[05/18/2023 6:10 PM] 5298_
By the time the nonce is out the child they sent the picture of will probably still be under 18

Ukraine is losing the way and theres no way you can tell me otherwise


[05/18/2023 6:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theyve been pratically pushed out of bakhmut despite what the media says


[05/18/2023 6:12 PM] 5298_
Poland seems like they want to get involved


[05/18/2023 6:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[05/18/2023 6:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Have they not learned


[05/18/2023 6:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Might have a very strong army now but i doubt it would do much


[05/18/2023 6:13 PM] 5298_
If they do Ukraine will still be fucked but they'll ""win"" because Russia will also be fucked


[05/18/2023 6:13 PM] 5298_
If Poland gets involved they'll want to invoke article 5 which would probably kill the West and Russia


[05/18/2023 6:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They couldnt even if htey wanted


[05/18/2023 6:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Article 5 can only be activated if youre not the aggressor


[05/18/2023 6:18 PM] 5298_
Which is why Poland is jumping at any form of bomb that lands there


[05/18/2023 6:19 PM] 5298_
They found one that was 5 months old they immediately wanted to invoke article 5 but NATO refused, I think it was because it would have been embarrassing to go to war over a 5 month old bomb

[05/18/2023 8:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i was confused by this site lmfao


[05/18/2023 8:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mulvey was brought over by the french in 1066 then those mulveys immigrated to ireland


[05/18/2023 8:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But I DONT THINK SO


[05/18/2023 8:14 PM] 5298_

I like my name but I wish I chose something a bit more Irish


[05/18/2023 8:16 PM] 5298_
It's not a legal name yet so I could change it but that'd just be confusing and annoying


[05/18/2023 8:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Do people actually the say the name rylan as rylen


[05/18/2023 8:17 PM] 5298_

An Tr√≠√∫ Reich


[05/18/2023 8:41 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Im reading through some reddit post about cumbrian identity and it seems that a lot of people from cumbria get told they have a bit of a geordie accent


[05/18/2023 8:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i think further up north theres a scottish twang too and maybe theres a bit of one in barrow but i dont hear it


[05/18/2023 8:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
barrow is a bit unique because of all the immigrants that came here


[05/18/2023 8:43 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cornish people a long with scottish probably irish people from yorkshire


[05/18/2023 8:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It seems that cumbrians like to be cumbrians and not english


[05/18/2023 8:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Holy shit westmorland and furness council actually care about us


[05/18/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
We're probably the most important town in their jurisdiction


[05/18/2023 9:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[05/18/2023 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But even barrow council didnt give 2 shits about barrow


[05/18/2023 9:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they barely did anything over than let the place rot


[05/18/2023 9:22 PM] 5298_
Ulverston, Grange and Kendal too but we're still very important


[05/18/2023 9:23 PM] 5298_
Making Barrow better just makes sense because we have a huge employer that could greatly benefit the council if they made more people want to move and work here


[05/18/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They need to completely clean town up


[05/18/2023 9:23 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
town and the surrounding areas are all a mess#

[05/18/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They ruin everything


[05/18/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
They probably decrease land value too after they burn down and cant be fully demolished


[05/18/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
I think they're important


[05/18/2023 9:25 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont


[05/18/2023 9:25 PM] 5298_
I love history and I believe we should preserve as much as possible


[05/18/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes but after the history burns down and theres nout to salvage then they shouldnt be sat there making the area look fucking horrid


[05/18/2023 9:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like the continental bar


[05/18/2023 9:26 PM] 5298_
Fair enough


[05/18/2023 9:26 PM] 5298_
It depends on how the building gets destroyed


[05/18/2023 9:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If the buildings destroyed then demolish the remains


[05/18/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
If the destruction is of great historical significance then don't


[05/18/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[05/18/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but a bar burning down in barrow isnt historically significant


[05/18/2023 9:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i dont even think the town hall burning down would be historically significant


[05/18/2023 9:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I killed a man's family and ruined his life


[05/18/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
It was brutal


[05/18/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
I dismembered his wife and hung her with her limbs under her, and I disemboweled his fucking daughter, I cut a little girls stomach open and left them there for him to come home to, then I burned down his place of work and any job he tried to get after that I'd burn down so he was destitute with only his nightmares of the massacre of his family


[05/18/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
I need help

Theres an irish pub right outside of my hotel in tenerife called the dubliner and my dad said one of the bad reviews was because they started playing ira music

[05/19/2023 6:14 PM] 5298_
It started as some Scottish ex-confederates playing pranks on ex-slaves, they would dress up and talk in funny voices to scare people and then it slowly became a violent militant terrorist group


[05/19/2023 6:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
lmfao


[05/19/2023 6:15 PM] 5298_
They literally just put some colourful masks on and pretended to be ghosts and then some more people joined and started patroling voting booths to stop black people from voting and then they just killed them outright

The very language is biased


[05/19/2023 10:28 PM] 5298_
You either say Northern Ireland and Londonderry or you say Ulster and Derry


[05/19/2023 10:30 PM] 5298_
I don't think I can name any other conflict where the oppressed party lost a quarter of their land and is called a victory than the Irish war of independence


[05/19/2023 10:31 PM] 5298_
No where else could be oppressed and stripped of a quarter of their land and it be called a success for the oppressed


[05/19/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
It pisses me off when people say Shakespeare spoke middle English


[05/19/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
He spoke modern English


[05/19/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
He did speak middle english tho


[05/19/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_
It's just an early version of modern English


[05/19/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
modern english didnt come about until 1700s


[05/19/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Shakespeare sort of put it on the track to modern english


[05/19/2023 10:37 PM] 5298_
Began in the late 14th century


[05/19/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats just INCORRECT!


[05/19/2023 10:38 PM] 5298_
Modern English was fully formed in the 1700's but it's earliest form of Modern English rather than Middle English is 1500's


[05/19/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Actually fair enough


[05/19/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It was very early modern english but it was modern english


[05/19/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
It took 200 years for it to develop and Shakespeare lived in those years


[05/19/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wish the dirty french scum never came


[05/19/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so we spoke germanic language


[05/19/2023 10:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dutch is very similar to german but it sounds more retarded


[05/19/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
English is so shit now


[05/19/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
English is up there with Dutch


[05/19/2023 10:40 PM] 5298_
It's so shit because it's a mix of so many different languages and then the bastardised amalgamation transformed on its own


[05/19/2023 10:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
FREAL


[05/19/2023 10:40 PM] 5298_
It's German, Old Norse and Romantic French mixed with a bit of Gaelic and left to fester for centuries


[05/19/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
I can pronounce old English but I have no idea what I'm reading

I'm starting to understand the case system now


[05/19/2023 10:49 PM] 5298_
There's multiple different versions of words based on the gender and case


[05/19/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
Se, pƒÅm and pone are all the same word but different cases


[05/19/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fair enough


[05/19/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Old english pronunciation is pretty darn fricked

[05/19/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_

[05/19/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_

I don't like to learn languages the way I'm probably supposed to


[05/19/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
I should probably learn the basic sentence structure then the sounds and the words and how they all fit together but I just jump straight to learning sentences


[05/19/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
I could learn loads of old English sentences but I'd have no clue how to make one


[05/19/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
German word order is svo unless its a question and then it becomes vso


[05/19/2023 11:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or thats what i firgure


[05/19/2023 11:03 PM] 5298_
I don't know what that means, I'm guessing v is verb and o is object


[05/19/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[05/19/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and s is subject


[05/20/2023 12:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I remember that one time when you said that latin isnt a dead language because people still learn and write and shit in it


[05/20/2023 12:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it is a dead language because no people natively speak it


[05/20/2023 12:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
thats what a dead language is


[05/20/2023 12:41 PM] 5298_

Christianity is a little bit silly


[05/20/2023 12:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The holy spirit didnt give the knowledge of any language to the disciples


[05/20/2023 12:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
they just travelled across the roman empire and spoke latin to spread the message of jesus


[05/20/2023 12:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The reason christianity is so popular today is because of the roman empire


[05/20/2023 12:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
not because the disciples went across the world spreading his message in different languages but rather spread the message in rome


[05/20/2023 12:57 PM] 5298_
Fr


[05/20/2023 12:57 PM] 5298_
Once the Emperor was converted so was the world


[05/20/2023 12:57 PM] 5298_
The entirety of the Roman Empire would become Christian from Ireland all the way to India


[05/20/2023 12:58 PM] 5298_
Then they would spread the religion


[05/20/2023 1:01 PM] 5298_
It's a bit mental that a religion started in Israel was mainly spread through Rome


[05/20/2023 1:01 PM] 5298_
And currently the biggest denomination is housed in Rome

I don't want Northern Independence I want Scottish independence with the north alongside them


[05/21/2023 7:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
independence would put us in a worse place because we've been left to rot and couldnt hold up an economy


[05/21/2023 7:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cumbria and that one bit of the very far north of england are the only places that make sense to be part of scotland

It could work a bit like Washington but I guess it already does


[05/21/2023 7:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It cant be independent though because that means being an entirely different country

Ireland is a very funny place sir
It's a strange and a troubled land 
And the Irish are a very funny race sir
Every woman's in Cumann a mBann 
Every doggies got a tricoloured ribbon
Tied firmly to its tail 
And it wouldn't be surprising if there'd be another rising 
Said the man from the daily mail

Oh every bird upon word
Singing Yo Ho I'm a Provo
Every hen in jail is laying hand grenades
Over there sir
I do declare sir
And every old cock in the farmyard stock 
Is singing triumph to Sinn Fein 
And it wouldn't be surprising

He's a weird naked man in the woods near Annesburg who howls like a wolf


[05/22/2023 9:04 PM] 5298_
I chased him and he ran into a cave where he got trained wolves to attack me but I killed them and the man and he had a cock


[05/22/2023 9:05 PM] 5298_

West Shore Park was recognised by the Walney Island Strategy to be at significant erosion risk and at the time of the strategy, the rate of erosion was estimated to be up to 1.2 m per year, based on data from 2008 to 2013. Further erosion took place in winter 2013 to 2014.

I'm so fucked tomorrow


[05/23/2023 7:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Why


[05/23/2023 7:51 PM] 5298_
I got into a massive argument with someone in the hub and I don't think I'm going to be able to stay there during break and lunch anymore without getting into an argument every time and the person I argued with is friends with all my friends so I'm probably going to lose most of my friends and there was that whole thing outside at lunch which I'm probably getting harassed over so I can't go anywhere or do anything tomorrow


[05/23/2023 7:52 PM] 5298_
I don't want to go in


[05/23/2023 7:53 PM] 5298_
I want to just skip school and go to the abbey or some shit all day but I can't


[05/23/2023 7:59 PM] 5298_

[05/23/2023 10:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What if i come back from the summer holidays with a really heavy irish accent


[05/23/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
Listen to Irish music, watch Irish shows and movies and YouTubers


[05/23/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
It'd still be a weird Irish accent


[05/23/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
Unless you listen to specifically one accent


[05/23/2023 10:49 PM] 5298_
It'll be an amalgamation of loads of Irish accents but to the untrained ear you'd sound like you lived there

Like 2 years ago i started picking up those weird vowels they have in welsh in my accent


[05/23/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
I'm listening to music with my girlfriend and I'm going to play loads of IRA music


[05/23/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cause i had a welsh friend who id call sometimes and they sounded english apart from the vowels and then after like 3 calls i picked up the vowels and sounded the same but with the weird welsh vowel things


[05/23/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
I don't like the Welsh accent


[05/23/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_

I think its just easier for me to pick up accents


[05/23/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
if playing sea of thieves with my welsh mate a few times can give me the fucking welsh vowel system then anything is possible

[05/24/2023 3:51 PM] 5298_
Apparently she was bleeding from the head


[05/24/2023 3:52 PM] 5298_
The ambulance left quite slowly and without the sirens which you wouldn't expect for an emergency


[05/24/2023 3:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe she was but like you said ambulane would've rushed but maybe didn't want to disturb gcses with sirens


[05/24/2023 3:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Doubt its out serious but she took a weed vape and it made her collapse


[05/24/2023 3:54 PM] 5298_
That's it üíÄ


[05/24/2023 3:55 PM] 5298_
I heard she had two packets of paracetamol and OD'd


[05/24/2023 3:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe but everyone else is saying that she had a weed vape

[05/24/2023 6:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Probs got bad concussion or something tho


[05/24/2023 6:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
only bleeding from head for friction burn probably


[05/24/2023 6:46 PM] 5298_
I don't know but Tom's hair is bad bro


[05/24/2023 6:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I think Sadie is the only one that gained anything by the end


[05/24/2023 7:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Sadie was an alright character but also a bit of a knob


[05/24/2023 7:04 PM] 5298_
Everyone lost either their life or their livelihood but Sadie went from nothing to a bounty hunter in South America


[05/24/2023 7:04 PM] 5298_
I like her


[05/24/2023 7:04 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She only cared about her husband and threw lives away for nothing


[05/24/2023 7:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
That balloon guy was just some dude trying to make it but she didnt care and put him in danger which led to his death then she showed no remorse


[05/24/2023 7:05 PM] 5298_
She was brash but if your spouse died, your house was burned down and you fell in with a gang where one of the members tried to rape you, you would be too


[05/24/2023 7:05 PM] 5298_
Fair


[05/24/2023 7:05 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She threw innocent lives away in the name of revenge


[05/24/2023 7:07 PM] 5298_
Fair enough, I still liked her


[05/24/2023 7:08 PM] 5298_
Arthur also killed lots of innocent people for money


[05/24/2023 7:08 PM] 5298_
Charles was the only morally gray person


[05/24/2023 7:08 PM] 5298_
He wasn't good but he wasn't bad


[05/24/2023 7:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fair but Sadie was sort of different


[05/24/2023 7:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Arthurs cause was bad but sadies was just fucking stupid and very hypocritical


[05/24/2023 7:22 PM] 5298_
I think if she fell in with the gang earlier she would have been better


[05/24/2023 7:23 PM] 5298_
If she learnt everything Dutch could have taught her before Micah's intervention


[05/24/2023 7:26 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Me and you should learn cumbraek and communicate in only cumbraek at school


[05/24/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If cumbric was still around then cumbria would probably be called something similar to cymru


[05/24/2023 7:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
maybe just cymbru


[05/24/2023 7:28 PM] 5298_
By the time I can quasi-understand the language we'd be leaving school


[05/24/2023 7:29 PM] 5298_
I can learn codes really easy just not languages


[05/24/2023 7:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cumbraek is pretty simple


[05/24/2023 7:29 PM] 5298_
It's usually the grammar that fucks me up


[05/24/2023 7:30 PM] 5298_
I can't understand anything other than the English grammar system


[05/24/2023 7:33 PM] 5298_
What the fuck is r in Cumbraek


[05/24/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

I found some town near cork and it reminds me of dalton


[05/26/2023 4:48 PM] 5298_
What is it


[05/26/2023 4:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I wondered where callmekevin was from so i searched it up and it says he lived in middleton cork


[05/26/2023 4:49 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and it looks like dalton a lot


[05/26/2023 4:55 PM] 5298_
A bit


[05/26/2023 4:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
To me they look similar


[05/26/2023 4:58 PM] 5298_
It reminds me a bit of Ulverston


[05/26/2023 4:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[05/26/2023 4:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it feels like a mix but leaning more towards dalton


[05/26/2023 4:59 PM] 5298_
The houses are very Dalton but the town itself is more like Ulverston


[05/26/2023 4:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Some streets are more ulverston than dalton

She said Layla should get with me, not knowing she's my step sister, so I said I'd hit her and she said please


[05/26/2023 10:04 PM] 5298_
Bit odd


[05/26/2023 10:06 PM] 5298_

[05/26/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
The next day she came in with bandages on her arm from cutting herself


[05/26/2023 10:08 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Soldiers are we,
Whose lives are pledged to Ireland,
Some have come from a land beyond the wave,
Sworn to be free, no more our ancient sireland
Shall shelter the despot or the slave;
Tonight we man the Bearna Baoil
In Erin‚Äôs cause come woe or weal,
‚ÄòMid cannon‚Äôs roar and rifle‚Äôs peal,
We‚Äôll chant a soldier‚Äôs song.

Oh, Walney!
Oh, Walney!
You proudly sit right there!
Oh, Walney!
Oh, Walney!
Our invaders shall not dare!

The south shall not rule upon us,
An iron fist they show,
Their iron will not punch us
Our might we do bestow!

[05/27/2023 8:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But it feels off


[05/27/2023 8:26 PM] 5298_
It seems like a good war song but as a national song or anthem it wouldn't work because if you succeed in eliminating the south then it makes no sense


[05/27/2023 8:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[05/27/2023 8:34 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ukraine cant say anything about invading countries

Their army partook in the invasion of iraq

Lucus was fucking buzzing running around the whole site cause some girl added him out of nowhere on snap months ago and he thought he saw her there so he messaged her and she said yeah and we ended up sitting behind her without knowing and lucus was dropping pure game


[06/01/2023 7:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/02/2023 12:32 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WAYS


[06/02/2023 12:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Idk


[06/02/2023 12:33 AM] 5298_
It's also made me realise that maybe I don't like immigrants


[06/02/2023 12:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ive been feeling a little like that


[06/02/2023 12:33 AM] 5298_
It's because of my whole culture thing


[06/02/2023 12:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I dont mind them but i hate how a lot of them feel entitled to force their culture on us and not learn the laws of the country


[06/02/2023 12:33 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
A lot of them turn up here and just assume its the same as back home


[06/02/2023 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
so they go around raping people and all that


[06/02/2023 12:34 AM] 5298_
I think that should be the same both ways


[06/02/2023 12:34 AM] 5298_
If you intend to go or move to a country you should learn a bit about that country


[06/02/2023 12:34 AM] 5298_
The laws, customs, language ect.


[06/02/2023 12:34 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah exactly


[06/02/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The thing is a lot of immigrants from any country come somewhere then immediately want it to be like how it was back home


[06/02/2023 12:35 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Even tho the vast majority of the time they left because of how bad it was


[06/02/2023 12:35 AM] 5298_
I've also learnt that I don't like same sex marriage


[06/02/2023 12:36 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Lmfao


[06/02/2023 12:36 AM] 5298_
Marriage is a religious thing


[06/02/2023 12:36 AM] 5298_
If the religion says no to same sex marriage then it shouldn't happen


[06/02/2023 12:36 AM] 5298_
I don't give a shit about relationships but marriage is not for gay people

I think they should be higher

[06/02/2023 12:46 AM] 5298_
Why are there so many fucking questions


[06/02/2023 12:46 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fr


[06/02/2023 12:47 AM] 5298_
I'm at the crime and punishment section and this is going to be interesting


[06/02/2023 12:48 AM] 5298_
I believe that utopia is in anarchy but I myself am not an anarchist


[06/02/2023 12:48 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Depends on the disability dont it

[06/02/2023 12:48 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If its something that impairs them completely then yeah


[06/02/2023 12:48 AM] 5298_
No


[06/02/2023 12:48 AM] 5298_
I disagree


[06/02/2023 12:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theyre still life


[06/02/2023 12:49 AM] 5298_
Would you say you're better than Hawking? He was completely impaired


[06/02/2023 12:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But say theyre so impaired they dont even know they exist then


[06/02/2023 12:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats what i mean


[06/02/2023 12:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Brain dead people are considered disabled right?


[06/02/2023 12:49 AM] 5298_
Yeah


[06/02/2023 12:49 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Thats what i mean


[06/02/2023 12:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If youre brain dead then you should just be killed because you wont ever experience life again


[06/02/2023 12:50 AM] 5298_
If you're completely mentally disabled I'm not even sure you're human


[06/02/2023 12:50 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fair


[06/02/2023 12:50 AM] 5298_
To be human has so much to do with your mind


[06/02/2023 12:50 AM] 5298_
That's what separates us from animals, our superior minds


[06/02/2023 12:51 AM] 5298_
If you have no use of your mind then you shouldn't have human rights but you should have animal rights


[06/02/2023 12:51 AM] 5298_
That's probably a disgusting thing to say


[06/02/2023 12:51 AM] 5298_
It's the same reason I'm pro-abortion


[06/02/2023 12:51 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[06/02/2023 12:51 AM] 5298_
That foetus isn't human yet


[06/02/2023 12:51 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
For me life begins at the first moment of consciousness


[06/02/2023 12:51 AM] 5298_
Same


[06/02/2023 12:51 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes the thing has a right to live but only if it is already alive


[06/02/2023 12:52 AM] 5298_
I think that abortion should only be a last choice


[06/02/2023 12:52 AM] 5298_
If you really need it


[06/02/2023 12:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[06/02/2023 12:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I am pro choice but im also a bit of pro life too


[06/02/2023 12:52 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Cause the baby has the right to live but the woman has the right to her body


[06/02/2023 12:53 AM] 5298_
If it will kill you or severely physically impair you to give birth then abortion is okay


[06/02/2023 12:53 AM] 5298_
I don't think that rape babies should be aborted solely because they're the product of rape


[06/02/2023 12:53 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/02/2023 12:54 AM] 5298_
If the woman finds it too mentally damaging then just put them up for adoption


[06/02/2023 12:54 AM] 5298_
Do they mean Third Reich or Furry Hitler?


[06/02/2023 12:54 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

That's just suicide


[06/02/2023 12:56 AM] 5298_

[06/02/2023 12:57 AM] 5298_
FUCK


[06/02/2023 12:57 AM] 5298_
I closed the test when I googled Furry Hitler


[06/02/2023 12:58 AM] 5298_

[06/02/2023 1:00 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
WTF


[06/02/2023 1:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nah cause its not even that i hold that many transphobic or homophobic views but it classes all of the questions of being of that category or something and it makes it seem worse than it is


[06/02/2023 1:01 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its the same views ive shared with you


[06/02/2023 1:01 AM] 5298_
That's about what I expected minus the homophobia and transphobia


[06/02/2023 1:02 AM] 5298_
How did you do that in half the time it took me to do half the test


[06/02/2023 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
PC advantage


[06/02/2023 1:02 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and fast wifi sped


[06/02/2023 1:02 AM] 5298_
I'll do it on my laptop now because I'm interested in what my views are


[06/02/2023 1:03 AM] 5298_
I'm also redoing the political compass for the third time to see if I've changed again


[06/02/2023 1:03 AM] 5298_
I feel I might have gone a bit more up


[06/02/2023 1:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I might be going right again on the political compass


[06/02/2023 1:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to take a test every month compile them and see how my views shift


[06/02/2023 1:04 AM] 5298_

[06/03/2023 11:58 PM] 5298_
I think it'd be an even fight


[06/03/2023 11:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe


[06/03/2023 11:58 PM] 5298_
You probably have the upper hand because of gym

I used to have a really powerful punch but its gone now


[06/04/2023 12:03 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/04/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
he used to always attack me and that so i was sick of it and then i kept punching him dead hard in the face and one of his teeth went through his upper lip


[06/04/2023 12:04 AM] 5298_
If it was a proper scrap like no rules no honour no nothing you'd win


[06/04/2023 12:04 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe


[06/04/2023 12:05 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im still weak as fuck tho


[06/04/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
I ain't good in a fight


[06/04/2023 12:05 AM] 5298_
My only chance in a fight is to be a cunt


[06/04/2023 12:11 AM] 5298_
I think I might cut my hair


[06/04/2023 12:13 AM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/04/2023 12:14 AM] 5298_

1270 A.D was a bad year to be in Tunisia, nobody won üò¢ 
Also, take me back to when the French used trilled R's üòÇ

After GTA6 we're probably getting a new red dead game


[06/05/2023 7:34 PM] 5298_
In 5 years but still


[06/05/2023 7:34 PM] 5298_
It's either red dead or a new game


[06/05/2023 7:35 PM] 5298_
But I doubt they'd do something new


[06/05/2023 7:36 PM] 5298_
The last time they did something new was 2006


[06/05/2023 9:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/05/2023 9:11 PM] 5298_
I nearly lost my love of literature that night it was awful

[06/05/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
I do leave the house


[06/05/2023 9:12 PM] 5298_
But not often


[06/05/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
I'll be fine


[06/05/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
School is so shit and the only joy anyone gets now is from pissing about


[06/05/2023 9:13 PM] 5298_
I like the lessons


[06/05/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Tiktok means that now pretty much everyone has an attention span of 10 seconds so its impossible to teach real lessons


[06/05/2023 9:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I got on called again in french today and it was pretty hilarious


[06/05/2023 9:14 PM] 5298_
The only time I like school is in some lessons where I can actually learn and break, but some times I don't even like break


[06/05/2023 9:15 PM] 5298_
Because of my whole episode in the hub a few weeks ago when Millie's in I can't talk to anyone and half the time they're all staring at me so I go sit in the hallway

[06/05/2023 9:17 PM] 5298_
All I really do now is sleep and watch YouTube


[06/05/2023 9:18 PM] 5298_
I do so little that I'm now struggling to find YouTube videos to watch because I've watched everything from everyone I like about ten times


[06/05/2023 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/05/2023 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/05/2023 9:18 PM] 5298_
It's a fucking godsend when I find a new YouTuber


[06/05/2023 9:19 PM] 5298_
I then watch all their videos


[06/05/2023 9:20 PM] 5298_
I need a fucking life


[06/05/2023 9:23 PM] 5298_
If I didn't have people to talk to I'd be fucking ruined

Hitler is quite an impressive figure


[06/05/2023 9:30 PM] 5298_
No matter how evil he is it's fucking impressive what he did


[06/05/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
I think that's what makes him such an imposing and terrifying figure and what makes fascism and Nazism so horrifying


[06/05/2023 9:31 PM] 5298_
Hitler is a testament to the majesty of words


[06/05/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
uh oh


[06/05/2023 9:33 PM] 5298_
I'm not commending anything he did


[06/05/2023 9:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Stage 1: Denial


[06/05/2023 9:34 PM] 5298_
But it's impressive and terrifying that a poor, school failure with a horrible family can rise from nothing and take nearly an entire continent and cause so much evil and destruction


[06/05/2023 9:36 PM] 5298_
He could hardly speak his own language in school and he caused the death of 60 million people and owned 823,505 km2 of land at one point

Three and a half grand and you won't be able to charge it üíÄ


[06/05/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The main reason its thriving is due to gaming its not that common for workspaces to implement vr


[06/05/2023 10:51 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Exactly


[06/05/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Nobody wants to pay 3 and a half grand for a vr that is dog shit when you get a quest 3 for 7 times cheaper and most likely better

Now you can queue outside an apple shop for an overpriced phone in Vr!


[06/05/2023 10:54 PM] 5298_
For the low low cost of your car


[06/05/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You can now see cubes in 3d inside your own home


[06/05/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/05/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
ALL IT DOES IS 3D PHOTOS


[06/05/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND POUNDS TO SEE A PICTURE


[06/05/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its a mixed reality


[06/05/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Meta did one probably just as good for 1 grand


[06/05/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its still a lot but its target audience is work environments


[06/05/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
It's just a fucking iPad you strap to your head


[06/05/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/05/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
What's the point


[06/05/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
apple wants to compete with meta but its gonna be a massive flop


[06/05/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
I don't know why apple is such a big industry


[06/05/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_
It makes sense when they were like the innovators but now they're shite


[06/05/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
Android are far better at phones and a blind dog with no limbs could make a better vr headset


[06/05/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
Not if fucking doesn't

Apple is fucking stupid


[06/05/2023 11:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/05/2023 11:03 PM] 5298_

It sounds like a stroke


[06/06/2023 3:40 PM] 5298_

[06/06/2023 9:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Real


[06/06/2023 9:16 PM] 5298_
I don't get why people hate him


[06/06/2023 9:16 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Ik he is best teacher by far


[06/06/2023 9:16 PM] 5298_
Last year my mates were saying how awful he is


[06/06/2023 9:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Along side mrs pharoah and that


[06/06/2023 9:18 PM] 5298_
I think my favourite teachers are Mr. O'Donnell, Ms. Pharaoh, our old Maths teacher I've forgotten the name of and Mr. Mills


[06/06/2023 9:18 PM] 5298_
Pretty much everyone else is a dick


[06/06/2023 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Mrs dugan or mrs massey?


[06/06/2023 9:18 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[06/06/2023 9:19 PM] 5298_
Actually both were great, Mrs. Massey was so nice to me in year 7


[06/06/2023 9:21 PM] 5298_

[06/06/2023 9:44 PM] 5298_
I saw Isabel checking her report in Computing but I don't know if it's the new one or her old one


[06/06/2023 9:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

Jamie's entitled, Ethan doesn't talk to anyone and he's full of himself, Lucas thinks he's hard when he really isn't and Addison is 7 trying to be a roadman. Freddie is alright but he's 6 and Megan actually treats me like a friend


[06/06/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
And I don't see Brad


[06/06/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
Last time I saw him was 2018


[06/06/2023 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/06/2023 10:07 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wonder if i know any


[06/06/2023 10:07 PM] 5298_
Jamie, Megan and Brad are Mulvey


[06/06/2023 10:09 PM] 5298_
Jamie and Megan are twins and in year 11 Chetwynd, Brad is adopted and in his 20's, Ethan, Lucas and Addison are all Hirds, Ethan is in year 11 Academy, Lucas is a year 7 also in Academy and Addison is 7 years old, Freddie is a Fenton and also in year 1


[06/06/2023 10:09 PM] 5298_
You won't know any, maybe Ethan


[06/06/2023 10:09 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My stepbrother will know lucas


[06/06/2023 10:09 PM] 5298_
Ethan is the only one who socialises that isn't a child


[06/06/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/06/2023 10:10 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/06/2023 10:10 PM] 5298_
Jamie is a fucking slob


[06/06/2023 10:10 PM] 5298_
He does fuck all


[06/06/2023 10:10 PM] 5298_
The last time he did anything noteworthy is when his Dad forced him to do Cadets for the summer two years ago


[06/06/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
His sister's alright though, Megan's actually alright


[06/06/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
I like kind of not really have more but I don't count them


[06/06/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
They count me as their cousin but I don't them


[06/06/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
You know Jacob Friday in year 11


[06/06/2023 10:11 PM] 5298_
Our school


[06/06/2023 10:11 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[06/06/2023 10:12 PM] 5298_
His Dad is my auties ex-husband


[06/06/2023 10:12 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No way


[06/06/2023 10:12 PM] 5298_
All the Mulveys fucking hate his Dad


[06/06/2023 10:12 PM] 5298_
So Jacob calls him and Teagan my cousin but they don't fucking count


[06/06/2023 10:13 PM] 5298_
Their Dad used to be married to my auntie


[06/06/2023 10:13 PM] 5298_
They're fucking ex-step-cousins


[06/06/2023 10:13 PM] 5298_

karl boyle


[06/06/2023 10:14 PM] 5298_
I don't know who that is


[06/06/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
very very big one


[06/06/2023 10:14 PM] 5298_
Oh right


[06/06/2023 10:14 PM] 5298_
I think I know who you're on about


[06/06/2023 10:14 PM] 5298_
The fat tall one?


[06/06/2023 10:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yes


[06/06/2023 10:16 PM] 5298_
Is this just me but I'm fucking terrified of looking at people in public


[06/06/2023 10:17 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Same


[06/06/2023 10:17 PM] 5298_
On the rare occasion when I'm out I always look at the ground or my phone so people don't think I'm staring at them


[06/06/2023 10:17 PM] 5298_
Once I was waiting for my friend and a girl came up to me and shouted at me saying I was plotting to rape her and her friend


[06/06/2023 10:18 PM] 5298_
I was 11


[06/06/2023 10:18 PM] 5298_
They were like 15


[06/06/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
Having eyes is a death sentence


[06/06/2023 10:19 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
LMFAO


[06/06/2023 10:19 PM] 5298_
I was so fucking shocked


[06/06/2023 10:20 PM] 5298_
I was 11 years old and some fucking girl came up to me and just shouted in the middle of the street "STOP LOOKING AT US, WOMEN HAVE RIGHTS IT ISN'T THE 1500'S YOU CAN'T RAPE US, KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS YOU PERV"


[06/06/2023 10:37 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Man i still cant believe my uncles dead


[06/06/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
been 7 months and it still feels fresh


[06/06/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I will never tell my mum that Im sure i saw the ambulance that took him away


[06/06/2023 10:38 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Well i might but i dont want to upset her


[06/06/2023 10:41 PM] 5298_
My Grandad nearly died last week


[06/06/2023 10:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
How


[06/06/2023 10:44 PM] 5298_
He had a stroke and was blue lighted to Preston


[06/06/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
It's the first time I'd ever seen my dad cry


[06/06/2023 10:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Is he ok now


[06/06/2023 10:45 PM] 5298_
Yeah he's fine, in the ambulance he was asking to get pizza first


[06/06/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
I'm very lucky


[06/06/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
No one close to me had died


[06/06/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its the worst fucking feeling ever and it completely destroys you mentally especially when theyre young


[06/06/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
My uncle dying is the reason my mental health has been so fucking shit


[06/06/2023 10:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I didnt see him that often but he was so young and it made me question everything


[06/06/2023 10:47 PM] 5298_
I know it's not the same but I've had close encounters with death and I've been mortified


[06/06/2023 10:48 PM] 5298_
I remember once I thought my friend had killed himself and I lay in bed all night thinking about what I could have done to make his life better


[06/06/2023 10:49 PM] 5298_
I entirely blamed myself


[06/06/2023 10:50 PM] 5298_
I thought his last words were him shouting at how much he hated me and how selfish I was


[06/06/2023 10:51 PM] 5298_
The next day I apologized for everything I'd done and he apologized for saying what he said and I never spoke to him again


[06/06/2023 10:52 PM] 5298_
I didn't speak to anyone for months because I thought it would happen again, I thought I would kill someone by being me


[06/06/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The last words my uncle said to me was life advice


[06/06/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think he knew his time was coming because he told my mam that he thought he wasnt getting out of the relationship alive


[06/06/2023 10:52 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She needs to be charged with manslaughter


[06/06/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She let her old bf kill himself and told him, let me uncle overdose while she went through his phone and put another in the hospital


[06/06/2023 10:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then she tried to date an 18 year old when she was 30


[06/06/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Justice is gonna be fucking served, by the law or not


[06/06/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Shes got money on her head


[06/06/2023 10:54 PM] 5298_
I don't know if it's any condolence but I think he's truly in a better place


[06/06/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Dont tell anyone about this discussion btw its really fucking personal


[06/06/2023 10:54 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I do too


[06/06/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
Whether that be a paradise or a better life


[06/06/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
He's free from that demon


[06/06/2023 10:55 PM] 5298_
Of course I won't


[06/06/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She apparently tried to kill herself after she died most likely for attention


[06/06/2023 10:55 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or so she could continue to harass him


[06/06/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She seems so insensitive about it


[06/06/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She let him fucking die


[06/06/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Shes the only person I want to fucking kill


[06/06/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I want to cause her nothing but pain


[06/06/2023 10:56 PM] 5298_
Justice will be served


[06/06/2023 10:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Shes taken 2 innocent lads away the little bastard


[06/06/2023 10:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
And tried to take a 3rd


[06/06/2023 10:57 PM] 5298_
She will face her actions, whether it be by law, personal justice, her own guilt or a divine punishment she will face the consequences for her sins and nothing but misery will befall her


[06/06/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She doesnt care that hes dead but pretends to


[06/06/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
She forced him to stay at her house with his kids that night when he was going to stay at my nanas


[06/06/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Had she not forced him to chances are he would be alive today


[06/06/2023 11:08 PM] 5298_
Digital footprints terrify me but I don't think I'd have to worry


[06/06/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_

[06/06/2023 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

It's will but I want to know Irish


[06/06/2023 11:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/06/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
All the rest of my friends will be with Millie and I would rather kill myself than hang around with her


[06/06/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
I actually fucking hate her


[06/06/2023 11:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Who tf is millie


[06/06/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
A mate of my mates


[06/06/2023 11:46 PM] 5298_
I hate her more than Isabel


[06/06/2023 11:47 PM] 5298_
She's a fucking cunt


[06/06/2023 11:47 PM] 5298_
She told my friend to kill herself when that friend wasn't even there and she scowls at me every day and if I try to talk to my friends she pushes me out of the way


[06/06/2023 11:48 PM] 5298_
I have had dreams about killing her


[06/06/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You actually need help

You know when I was outside having loads of panic attacks


[06/06/2023 11:48 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Yeah


[06/06/2023 11:48 PM] 5298_
It's because I had a massive argument with her


[06/06/2023 11:49 PM] 5298_
Probably


[06/06/2023 11:49 PM] 5298_
Absolute game

[06/07/2023 10:35 PM] 5298_

Tomorrow when the farm boys find this freak of nature,
 They will wrap his body in newspaper and carry him to the museum.

But tonight he is alive in the north field with his mother. 
It is a perfect summer evening: the moon rising over the orchard, 
The wind in the grass.
And when he stares into the sky,
There are twice as many stars as usual.

Church of the Godless 

I kept being told about a cathedral in Barcelona called La Sagrada Familia,
My friends would not stop banging on about it,
I grew up in England, I've seen a cathedral of two,
_No_, everyone replied with a significant glare. _This one is different_,

I found myself passing through Barcelona one week and thought what the hell and made it to the cathedral, 
It looked unusual from the outside certainly, 
At least if I went for five minutes that would shut everyone up,

I stood in line with the other tourists grumbling to myself about what a load of nonsense theology is, throwing a little one-man god is dead party,
Then went in
and had to summon most of my strength to stop my legs collapsing,

It was the bridge of an alien starship,
The window was blaring Tommyknockers green, nova star yellow,
The ceiling vaulted in fractals,
The columns reaching right up into Platonism,
And the overriding geometry of it all was from a universe not too distant from our own, but distant enough not to be our universe,

There was no point trying to resist the feeling of reverence, spacetime took a sabbatical,
For the first time in my life I wore an open mouth unironically,
I sat in the nave for maybe three hours just staring up and listening to Ave Maria and began to understand that look on my religious friends' faces when they talk about God,

When I left it wasn't because I was bored,
Rather the wonder was getting too much like when your mouth hurts from smiling,
I walked aimlessly around Barcelona with my soul carbonated,

The sads turned up at some point,
I listened to them for a while and realised it was mostly jealousy,
Jealousy that us godless folks don't have a church, a place to go and be reverent
or much in the way of tradition at all really, no arias or sermons,
Zero doughnuts,
How did we overlook this? I thought, 
 No wonder we have such terrible PR,


[06/07/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Fucking hell did you write that whole thing out

[06/07/2023 11:24 PM] 5298_
Come evening I sat on a hill and watched Barcelona getting darker,
Knowing no one there it was all a bit lonely,
Suddenly I remembered a story:

In the 1970s a pair of probes were being constructed,
Voyager 1 and Voyager 2
set to venture in somewhat opposite directions out of the solar system,
Two people working in the project had fallen in love that summer,
Carl Sagan the astronomer and Ann Druyan the creative director,

Together they were searching for the most defining music of the human species 
so those songs might be copied onto golden discs the probes would carry,
Perhaps to be received one day by extraterrestrials,

Though they had never kissed, had never expressed romantic interest in the other, Carl Sagan phones Ann Druyan one afternoon, and, after the most minimal confirmations that the two of them shared an attraction, Carl Sagan said, "So, for keeps?"
They were married soon after,

When the music had been finalised and the project seemed almost complete
they began to wonder if biorhythms could be decoded by an alien race,
And so Ann Druyan's brainwaves were recorded onto those golden records, a primitive snapshot of human consciousness,
And off to interstellar space the probes went,

After Carl Sagan's death now, Ann Druyan says it's a comfort to know the probes are still on their way,
Will keep going lost after we're gone,
Long after our civilization is gone,
Billions of miles distant, billions more to go,
Carrying: 
A mother's first words to her baby,
The songs of the humpback whale,
Beethoven and Louis Armstrong,
And, Ann Druyan confirms, the brain-music of how it felt one summer during the 20th century to be in love,
Offered as a greeting to alien ears a million years from now,

I looked up from the hill to the first constellations appearing for night,
Oh yeah, I thought,
There's our church.

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine 
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said well a blessa my soul 
You load sixteen tons whatda get?
Another day older and deeper in debt 
Oh Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[06/08/2023 10:46 PM] 5298_
Albion comes from the Latin word for white, the Romans called England that because of the white cliffs of Dover

If the majority of the country believes in one religion then it makes sense that the laws of that country should be based on that religion


[06/08/2023 11:14 PM] 5298_
We live in a very protestant country so it makes sense the country uses the bible to make it's laws


[06/08/2023 11:14 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It depends on the ruling religion


[06/08/2023 11:15 PM] 5298_
What do you mean


[06/08/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Like most the popular religions arent violent and that and match the moral standards of society anyway


[06/08/2023 11:15 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
But if a violent religion took hold of the government then it would be fucking chaos with the laws theyd be passing


[06/08/2023 11:17 PM] 5298_

I think enough of our generation is realized the flaws in our current system and Socialism and a leaning towards the left is rising so that in the next decade we're going to see a huge rise in left leaning voters and more laws being passed that lean towards the people


[06/11/2023 1:15 PM] 5298_
I think the Red Scare is the reason so many people live and die by capitalism, people were constantly fed the anti socialist dogma and then they fed it to their children but nowadays we don't get that and because we aren't constantly being told that Lenis is going to come back from the dead and charge an army to come and make you homeless and take your rights away we're finally seeing the flaws in our current structure and realising that right wing authoritarianism isn't actually benifiting anyone but the elite and the only way to secure a future for us and the future generations is to move into a more socialist society in which everything is catered towards the people who live in it

[06/11/2023 7:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Sort of


[06/11/2023 7:44 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I also think that theyre right to live and die by capitalism because communism just doesnt work


[06/11/2023 7:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Maybe for a few years it does


[06/11/2023 7:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
then it just breaks down


[06/11/2023 7:45 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Socialism maybe


[06/11/2023 7:45 PM] 5298_
I'm not on about communism, the people advocating for communism don't know what they're talking about


[06/11/2023 7:46 PM] 5298_
Communism is a socialist society with a capitalist authority


[06/11/2023 7:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Communism is an extreme version of socialism


[06/11/2023 7:46 PM] 5298_
Communism has never and will never work


[06/11/2023 7:46 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Communism is authoritarian whereas socialism is libetarian


[06/11/2023 7:47 PM] 5298_

I think it's supposed to represent the divinity God puts in people


[06/11/2023 8:25 PM] 5298_
Like the blessed descendants of Abraham


[06/11/2023 8:25 PM] 5298_
It's just saying this group of people is special

[06/11/2023 8:30 PM] 5298_
I don't think it is


[06/11/2023 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/11/2023 8:30 PM] 5298_
Especially not the Tenak


[06/11/2023 8:30 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The tenak cant be

The Torah will be a pretty good copy I'd say


[06/11/2023 8:31 PM] 5298_
Because it's a big thing to get it perfect


[06/11/2023 8:31 PM] 5298_
It won't be exact because of outside interference but it'll be close


[06/11/2023 8:31 PM] 5298_
And the Catholic Church heavily scrutinises all the texts


[06/11/2023 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

This is why i struggle to believe there is a god or there isnt a god


[06/11/2023 8:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Or one of the many reasons


[06/11/2023 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I think if there is a god its not like the one the abrahamic religions show


[06/11/2023 8:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
or tell about


[06/11/2023 8:35 PM] 5298_
It's a good argument but not perfect


[06/11/2023 8:35 PM] 5298_
God doesn't need to test us for an outcome He tests us so we can better ourselves


[06/11/2023 8:36 PM] 5298_
He can't better us for us because that's not free will and even if God is all powerful I don't think He'd be able to bend all logic


[06/11/2023 8:36 PM] 5298_
He can do anything but it would be completely impossible to say make a universe where the only direction is left


[06/11/2023 8:37 PM] 5298_
It makes no sense and is completely impossible and the universe wouldn't work so that's why we have right, same with good and evil


[06/11/2023 8:39 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No universe is impossible though theyre only impossible in our own comprehension


[06/11/2023 8:40 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If there truly are other universes then there is a universe where you can only go left


[06/11/2023 8:40 PM] 5298_
Then maybe God wanted to create a universe that wouldn't fundamentally break us


[06/11/2023 8:42 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
It wouldn't fundamentally break us because the fundamentals of us in this universe dont apply to the fundamentals of us in another universe


[06/11/2023 8:42 PM] 5298_
Maybe

Are they Jews mister? They sound like Jews. This whole thing is nothing but a Jewish plot. I don't like Jews. Or colored folk. Or natives, now that you mention it. I bet you like Catholics. I can't stand them neither. Nor women, Fabians, Socialists, homosexuals, Asians, or British. Between them, they've ruined this country. Ruined it. It was a good country once. Now, people are eating each other. And it's all the fault of the Jewish British Catholic homosexual elite and their ideas. Well, I for one won't stand for it.  

The Jews killed Lincoln. That's why there is a triangle on the money. And they run Europe like one of them Arabian harems. Now they've sent this here plague to kill all us decent folk. Yep.

I think we should get every society and ask them to draw where they think their borders are, then in all the overlapping territory, all the groups who want that land then have to draw their borders in that land and have a unanimous vote on the change, we do this for every society all over the world until we have one unified map that everyone drew. It would be a logistical nightmare and might start a billion wars but it'd be interesting

[06/15/2023 9:58 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I was attacking kenzie as per and some kid came over and said get off him and that then started grabbing me so i started strangling him then he elbowed me so i thought thats the end of it then he came back over and started trying to grab me and that so i held him off then we both tripped and on the way down i landed on his head and he started crying about his head lmfao


[06/15/2023 9:59 PM] 5298_
You were strangling him üíÄ


[06/15/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Not in the typical way


[06/15/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
its like an extreme headlock


[06/15/2023 9:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Its dead hard to get out of even if the person doing it isnt strong


[06/15/2023 9:59 PM] 5298_
Oh right I thought you just went full fucking Homer Simpson


[06/15/2023 10:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
You get them in front of you and make them face away then put one of you arms around their head like a headlock then get your other arm then cross it behind their neck


[06/15/2023 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Im a little stronger than i look because autism is power


[06/15/2023 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
In terms of fighting


[06/15/2023 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but not really in general


[06/15/2023 10:01 PM] 5298_
Fair enough


[06/15/2023 10:01 PM] 5298_
We should have a race some time


[06/15/2023 10:01 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I would lose probably


[06/15/2023 10:01 PM] 5298_
I wanna know who's faster


[06/15/2023 10:02 PM] 5298_
I might see if there's some like running club around here somewhere I can join because I really like running, if not I'll just do some in the field


[06/15/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
dont ever step foot on the field


[06/15/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
you will get fucking mauled by thousands of people


[06/15/2023 10:02 PM] 5298_
No the one at my house


[06/15/2023 10:02 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
(probably i cant say for certain)


[06/15/2023 10:03 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh right


[06/15/2023 10:03 PM] 5298_
Not at school


[06/15/2023 10:28 PM] 5298_
I think my parents are worried about me


[06/15/2023 10:29 PM] 5298_
I don't really do anything


[06/15/2023 10:30 PM] 5298_
I don't talk about school so all they know about my life is that I stay inside all the time and don't talk to anyone save for you


[06/15/2023 10:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wouldnt blame them honestly


[06/15/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
It's not even that I need friends because I have friends I just don't hang out with them outside of school


[06/15/2023 10:33 PM] 5298_
I don't think half of them like me


[06/15/2023 10:34 PM] 5298_
George definitely doesn't because I keep calling him a commie, Katya doesn't because I keep telling her to shut up and Freya won't because of George


[06/15/2023 10:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I fucking hate them lot anyway


[06/15/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I feel the same way about myself sometimes and other times i dont


[06/15/2023 10:39 PM] 5298_
At this point, a social life is a fruitless pursuit for me


[06/16/2023 4:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
What was wrong before?


[06/16/2023 4:27 PM] 5298_
I've not been too happy all day


[06/16/2023 4:27 PM] 5298_
I haven't said a word all day until about an hour ago


[06/16/2023 4:27 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Oh damn


[06/16/2023 4:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Was tryna get people to leave you alone since you looked pissed

My agoraphobia has gotten worse


[06/19/2023 10:58 PM] 5298_

[06/19/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
The whole time I was walking I could feel my chest getting tight and my face getting hot


[06/19/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
wait is that what a panic attack is


[06/19/2023 10:59 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i thought it was worse than that


[06/19/2023 10:59 PM] 5298_
A panic attack is worse than that, I felt like that before the panic attack


[06/19/2023 11:00 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
oh


[06/19/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
A panic attack is where you can't breathe


[06/19/2023 11:00 PM] 5298_
It's like the air is escaping your lungs and you feel trapped


[06/19/2023 11:01 PM] 5298_
I just have to keep moving when I have one or I feel like I'm stuck and I can't breathe so I'm gasping for air but then that makes it worse because I need to steady my breathing to calm down


[06/19/2023 11:02 PM] 5298_
I think it's the closest thing to drowning that isn't drowning

[06/19/2023 11:13 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/19/2023 11:20 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
like it was a dead nice classic-modern building and there was actually stuff to do and you didnt have to go to classes for some reason even tho its school


[06/19/2023 11:21 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

so looks like a knob


[06/19/2023 11:28 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i remember it in great detail cause it looked so beautiful and i thought that i had finally found a good place in life where i could hang out with friends and shit


[06/19/2023 11:28 PM] 5298_

[06/19/2023 11:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i just said


[06/19/2023 11:29 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
the building was a lot more majestic than that and some of the details are missing but i remember a couple of angles of it


[06/19/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
i remember what dream it was


[06/19/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was months ago


[06/19/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
there was an abandoned section of town like those streets


[06/19/2023 11:31 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and every house had been abandoned for like a year or 2


[06/19/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and there was like ghosts and shit


[06/19/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and me and a group of people i forgot were breaking into them


[06/19/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
but it looked very close to that


[06/19/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
it was like the street going down then the backstreet was connected in the middle to another like a junctoin


[06/19/2023 11:32 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
and it had one of them shitty town walls around it


[06/19/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_
I wonder if synchronization dreams are real


[06/19/2023 11:33 PM] 5298_

[06/19/2023 11:33 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

[06/19/2023 11:47 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907

He does mainly videos about Fascism and the Nazis but he has no idea what the Nazis believed in. He never calls Hitler a Nazi, they're always the National Socialist and he has an entire video about why Hitler was a socialist. He did a video about anti-semitic propaganda and didn't mention anything about the physical aspects of the propaganda and mainly talked about money for the whole thing then just started giving reasons as to why the Jews actually are greedy

Making serotonin to experience joy again!
Warning: do not attempt the actions seen in this video! 

In today's video, I'll be making a neurotransmitter called serotonin! This compound regulates many functions in the body from mood to bowel movements but is commonly called the happiness chemical! So follow me today as I turn over-the-counter supplements into serotonin!

Enjoy! :)

Backya...

And you talk to Reina quite a bit


[06/22/2023 10:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
I only talk to her cause they make me sit next to her in every seating plan


[06/22/2023 10:36 PM] 5298_

[06/23/2023 7:35 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
when did he make the submarine tweet


[06/23/2023 7:36 PM] 5298_
23 hours ago, they were probably dead by then


[06/23/2023 7:36 PM] 5298_
Although I've heard people think it's a hoax


[06/23/2023 7:36 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
The submarine imploded probably the moment it lost signal


[06/23/2023 7:36 PM] 5298_

[06/24/2023 5:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
No


[06/24/2023 5:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Wagner entered Russian territory and is heading to Moscow


[06/24/2023 5:53 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
as revenge because russia started killing their men

[06/24/2023 5:56 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
Theyll have to withdraw from ukraine


[06/24/2023 5:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
If they dont then theyre just allowing wagner to walk right into towns and cities


[06/24/2023 5:57 PM] Bradley Walsh#1907
cause pretty much the whole russian military is involved with ukraine


[06/24/2023 5:57 PM] 5298_
They should have fallen in the 1920's


[06/24/2023 5:57 PM] 5298_
And if they didn't have winter on their side they would have fallen when Hitler invaded


[06/24/2023 5:58 PM] 5298_
They're sending all the reinforcements they have to Moscow
